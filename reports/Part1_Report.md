## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Overview

The electric vehicle market in India is experiencing rapid growth, driven by government policies like FAME II, increasing environmental awareness, and technological advancements. Understanding public discourse, user experiences, and community discussions around EVs is crucial for market analysis, policy evaluation, and consumer sentiment tracking.

This project implements a focused web crawler that:
- Systematically collects EV-related content from social platforms
- Applies relevance scoring to prioritize high-quality content
- Builds typed link graphs for network analysis
- Provides comprehensive evaluation metrics
- Prepares data for downstream knowledge graph construction

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Focused Crawling Approach

#### 2.1.1 Seed Strategy

The crawler employs a **Cartesian product seeding strategy** combining subreddits and keywords:

**Subreddits**: `["ElectricVehicles", "IndianStreetBikes"]`  
**Keywords**: `["ev scooter", "electric two-wheeler", "Ather", "Ola S1", "FAME II", "battery swap", "charging", "subsidy", "fire"]`

This generates 18 seed combinations (2 × 9), ensuring comprehensive coverage of the domain while maintaining focus on Indian EV discussions.

#### 2.1.2 Frontier Management

The system implements a **priority-based frontier** using a max-heap data structure:

```python
class Frontier:
    def __init__(self):
        self._heap: list[_PQItem] = []
        self._seen: set[str] = set()
```

**Priority Calculation**:
```python
final_priority = content_score × recency_boost × authority_factor
```

**Admission Thresholds**:
- `tau_data = 2.0`: Minimum content score for dataset inclusion
- `tau_frontier = 1.2`: Minimum priority for frontier exploration

#### 2.1.3 Exploration Strategy

The crawler implements **multi-level exploration**:

1. **Level 0**: Seed searches (subreddit × keyword)
2. **Level 1**: Comments from admitted posts
3. **Level 2**: Recent submissions from active authors
4. **Level 3**: Cross-references and related discussions

### 2.2 Relevance Scoring Model

#### 2.2.1 Content Scoring Algorithm

```python
def content_score(text, keywords, brand_terms, policy_terms, 
                 brand_bonus=0.7, policy_bonus=0.4):
    base_score = 0.2 * token_hits + 0.6 * phrase_hits
    brand_score = brand_hits * brand_bonus
    policy_score = policy_hits * policy_bonus
    return base_score + brand_score + policy_score
```

**Scoring Components**:
- **Token Hits** (0.2 each): Individual keyword matches
- **Phrase Hits** (0.6 each): Multi-word phrase matches  
- **Brand Bonus** (0.7): Mentions of EV manufacturers
- **Policy Bonus** (0.4): References to government schemes

#### 2.2.2 Temporal Relevance

**Recency Boost**: Exponential decay with 72-hour half-life
```python
recency_boost = 2^(-hours_since / half_life_hours)
```

This ensures recent discussions receive higher priority while maintaining historical context.

### 2.3 Data Collection Platforms

#### 2.3.1 Reddit (Primary Platform)

**API**: PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper)

**Rate Limiting**: 0.8 requests/second  
**Content Types**: Stories only (type=story filter)
**Endpoint**: `https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/`

### 2.4 Data Processing Pipeline
