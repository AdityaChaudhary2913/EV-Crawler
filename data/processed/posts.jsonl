{"author_id": "bwz1ypa9", "author_name": "ChillerID", "body": "**Honda Activa EV Launch in India on Nov 27**  \n[https://gaadiwaadi.com/honda-activa-ev-launching-soon-in-india-what-we-know-so-far/](https://gaadiwaadi.com/honda-activa-ev-launching-soon-in-india-what-we-know-so-far/)\n\nHonda is launching its Activa EV, featuring two detachable Mobile Power Pack e: batteries, placed under the seat. These batteries are part of Honda's proprietary system, also used in Japan through Gachaco—a joint venture between Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and ENEOS established in 2022. Gachaco offers battery-swapping services for electric two-wheelers, relying on Honda’s standard Mobile Power Pack e: system.\n\n**Battery Swapping Gains Momentum in India**\n\nHonda's upcoming launch of the Activa EV is set to bring significant attention to battery swapping in India, underlining the vast potential of this market. It also signals the start of a competitive race in a rapidly growing segment. India’s size and demand for affordable, sustainable mobility solutions mean there’s ample space for multiple players.\n\nOver time, the best technology is likely to dominate, and Gogoro's battery-swapping solution, widely regarded as a leader in the field, has a strong chance to emerge as a key player in India. Its proven efficiency, adaptability, and established global presence provide it with a solid foundation to compete effectively against Honda and others.\n\n**Commitment of Other Japanese Manufacturers to Honda e: Swap**\n\nWhile Gachaco uses Honda’s technology in Japan, the commitment of other Japanese manufacturers to Honda's system appears uncertain. For instance, Yamaha employs Gogoro’s battery-swapping technology in Taiwan for its electric scooters. This demonstrates their openness to alternative technologies, potentially building separate variants for Honda’s and Gogoro’s systems based on strategic considerations like swapping station coverage. Early adoption of home charging could also play a critical role before swapping networks mature.\n\nIt's worth noting that Honda is a member of IBSA (India Battery Swapping Association) with their own brand Honda e: Swap and not Gachaco. It might be a sign of weakness for the collaboration of Japanese manufacturers and I wouldn't be surprised if Honda is facing challenges to convince other manufacturers to use it's Honda branded battery swapping system. Gogoro might have faced similar challenges in the recent past as it has aimed to be profiled as a scooter manufacturer instead of purely battery swapping network company. For example HERO Motocorp wasn't willing to use Gogoro's technology even if they initially signed MoU - although, this might change as Gogoro is repositioning itself back to battery swapping company.\n\n**The Role of Home Charging**\n\nInterestingly, Gogoro initially offered home chargers but discontinued them, focusing exclusively on battery swapping due to its popularity in Taiwan. While this enhances their competitive edge in battery-swapping, it limits accessibility for potential customers without network coverage. Notably, Gachaco introduced a home-charging option in April 2024, which could appeal to users outside network coverage. If Honda adopts home charging for the Activa EV in India, it might pressure Gogoro to reconsider its stance, especially in developing markets like India, South Korea, and the Philippines.\n\n**Gogoro’s Strategic Evolution**\n\nDuring the Q3 investor call, Henry Chiang stated:  \n*\"Although we have become a strong brand, we realize that we must return to who we are and get back to our core beliefs and vision for enabling the mass transition of gas-powered scooters to smart electric scooters.\"*\n\nThis reflects Gogoro's acknowledgment of past missteps. While the company initially positioned itself as the \"Android of EVs,\" focusing on partnerships and battery-swapping technology, it later doubled down its efforts toward manufacturing its own scooters. This conflicted with its original strategy of building scooters primarily to drive demand for its battery-swapping network.\n\nThe pivot was ambitious but costly, as competing with established motorcycle brands in price-sensitive markets proved highly challenging. In Taiwan, Gogoro successfully established itself as a market leader, but replicating this success in other regions has been far more difficult due to intense price competition and the dominance of well-entrenched players in the scooter industry. It might have also had a negative impact to attract PBGN partners.\n\nFortunately, Gogoro seems to be returning to its strengths—its world-class battery-swapping technology. With its innovative solutions and strong financial position, the company has a unique opportunity to solidify itself as the global leader in battery-swapping networks. This focus alone has the potential to grow Gogoro into a multibillion-dollar enterprise.\n\nTo succeed, Gogoro must prioritize nurturing its user base and ensuring high customer satisfaction - especially what comes to battery swapping solution. These efforts will be critical for convincing other Powered by Gogoro Network (PBGN) manufacturers to adopt its platform especially in the international markets. With its proven technology, Gogoro is well-positioned to shape the future of sustainable mobility while potentially expanding its business into other areas and become a widely recognized energy provider company.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nHonda's entry into the Indian market with battery-swapping could challenge competitors like Gogoro. Strategic collaborations, wide network coverage, and customer-friendly options like home charging will likely determine the winners in this space. Gogoro's renewed focus on its core competency—battery swapping—might be the right move to cement its position as a leader in the field while leaving vehicle manufacturing, at least outside Taiwan, to established companies.\n\nAdditional sources:\n\nLink to Gachaco's home charging plan announcement, April 2024:  \n[https://gachaco.co.jp/20240422](https://gachaco.co.jp/20240422)", "container_id": "ElectricVehicles", "container_name": "ElectricVehicles", "created_iso": "2024-11-24T13:19:49Z", "created_utc": 1732454389.0, "depth": 0, "fetched_iso": "2025-10-02T12:25:21Z", "hash_sha1": "a497291f6ae194d72c1e24bf319c73d337ea5d7e", "id": "1gyqsgr", "kind": "post", "lang": "en", "num_comments": 9, "outbound_domains": ["gaadiwaadi.com", "gaadiwaadi.com", "gachaco.co.jp", "gachaco.co.jp"], "outbound_urls": ["https://gaadiwaadi.com/honda-activa-ev-launching-soon-in-india-what-we-know-so-far/", "https://gaadiwaadi.com/honda-activa-ev-launching-soon-in-india-what-we-know-so-far/", "https://gachaco.co.jp/20240422", "https://gachaco.co.jp/20240422"], "parent_id": null, "platform": "reddit", "provenance": {"endpoint": "reddit.search", "query": "ev scooter", "subreddit": "ElectricVehicles"}, "relevance_features": {"content": 11.399999999999999, "priority": 5.66996334166899e-31, "recency": 4.973652054095606e-32}, "relevance_score": 11.399999999999999, "root_post_id": "1gyqsgr", "score_upvotes": 11, "sentences": [{"end": 130, "start": 0}, {"end": 215, "start": 130}, {"end": 395, "start": 215}, {"end": 574, "start": 396}, {"end": 699, "start": 575}, {"end": 902, "start": 701}, {"end": 980, "start": 903}, {"end": 1098, "start": 981}, {"end": 1291, "start": 1100}, {"end": 1444, "start": 1292}, {"end": 1642, "start": 1446}, {"end": 1745, "start": 1643}, {"end": 1945, "start": 1746}, {"end": 2042, "start": 1946}, {"end": 2181, "start": 2044}, {"end": 2401, "start": 2182}, {"end": 2572, "start": 2402}, {"end": 2772, "start": 2573}, {"end": 2955, "start": 2774}, {"end": 3093, "start": 2956}, {"end": 3213, "start": 3094}, {"end": 3401, "start": 3214}, {"end": 3704, "start": 3403}, {"end": 3763, "start": 3704}, {"end": 3965, "start": 3764}, {"end": 4089, "start": 3966}, {"end": 4228, "start": 4091}, {"end": 4475, "start": 4229}, {"end": 4542, "start": 4476}, {"end": 4647, "start": 4544}, {"end": 4815, "start": 4648}, {"end": 4904, "start": 4816}, {"end": 5058, "start": 4906}, {"end": 5220, "start": 5059}, {"end": 5432, "start": 5221}, {"end": 5549, "start": 5434}, {"end": 5696, "start": 5550}, {"end": 5919, "start": 5697}, {"end": 6024, "start": 5921}, {"end": 6027, "start": 6024}, {"end": 6056, "start": 6027}, {"end": 6059, "start": 6056}, {"end": 6071, "start": 6059}], "text": "Honda Launching Battery Swapping Scooter in India November 27\n**Honda Activa EV Launch in India on Nov 27**  \n[https://gaadiwaadi.com/honda-activa-ev-launching-soon-in-india-what-we-know-so-far/](https://gaadiwaadi.com/honda-activa-ev-launching-soon-in-india-what-we-know-so-far/)\n\nHonda is launching its Activa EV, featuring two detachable Mobile Power Pack e: batteries, placed under the seat.

{"author_id": "brarfzj", "author_name": "chilidoggo", "body": "I often help people on the weekly General Questions and Purchasing Advice thread, and have been thinking about doing something like this to compile my answers to common questions. I'm going to structure it like a guide for each part of the buying process, but it's more like a collection of my thoughts. I'd be happy to add to it if anyone has anything else to contribute! This is also US-centric (sorry). \n\n#The Starting Line\nSo you want to buy an EV eh? Awesome! The process is, in general, very similar to buying a standard internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle, but with a few key additional areas of research. I'm going to assume you generally know the basics of ICE vehicle ownership, and make this guide as specific as possible the electric portion of the vehicle purchasing. \n\nLet me say this up top though if you are on the fence for an EV. If you can charge at home and have a two-car (or more) household, you 100% should make one of those cars an EV. You'll save money on gas and oil changes, and experience the convenience of leaving home with a full \"tank\" every morning. You can get a used Chevy Bolt or Tesla for less than $10k almost anywhere in the US if you qualify for the $4k tax credit, and they're great vehicles that can completely cover 99% of driving needs (and obviously there's plenty of vehicles at higher prices). If that's all you need to hear, go for it. \n\n# Assess your situation\nAs always you should buy a car that suits your needs. Trucks for construction work, vans for families, etc. EVs are no different, but you should ask yourself a few additional questions to determine which, if any, EV is right for you: \n\n* The first, most important question - do you have a place to charge? The main benefit EV owners cite is that the vehicle can \"refuel\" at home, every night. In contrast, the \"worst\" part of the experience is public charging. Even for Superchargers, which are widely considered the most reliable and easiest to use network, charging takes longer than refueling with gas and almost always eliminates any cost savings from getting rid of gas. It's less common, but you can also 100% get by if you charge at work or a public area like a shopping center you regularly visit. \n* What's your normal daily mileage? How much battery do you need? Almost all full battery-powered EVs (BEVs) have >200 miles of range at this point. You could even look at plug-in hybrid EV (PHEVs) if you fit the specific use-case for it (short daily use, home charging, and regular longer road trips) although having a more complex vehicle that retains all the maintenance of a gas engine is, for many, too much of a drawback when BEVs are becoming so capable. \n* Do you plan to use this vehicle to regularly travel to a certain destination more than 100 miles away? Like a weekend ski trip or family in another state? You can use apps like plugshare or A Better Route Planner (ABRP) to plot out these trips and see what public charging is available. Almost nowhere in the US is completely inaccessible to EVs anymore, but some places are much less convenient. \n* Another way to ask the previous question is: do you have another vehicle in your household? A gas vehicle is, in 99% of cases, indisputably better for long distance travel compared to an EV. If you decide that your vehicle will only ever charge at home (outside of emergencies), you can completely ignore fast charging rates, which are relatively difficult to research and understand. \n* There are [calculators](https://afdc.energy.gov/calc/) online to [determine](https://chooseev.com/savings-calculator/) how much [you'll save](https://chargevc.org/ev-calculator/) on fuel by switching to electric. It obviously depends heavily on your particular situation, but rule of thumb is (assuming you charge at home) you'll spend 1/3 of what you spent on gas ($1500 in a year -> $500 in a year), and you'll have minimal maintenance costs. I will say that if money is very tight, you'll find the best value in optimizing your purchase for your needs. A used Bolt, Leaf, or eGolf from the late 2010s won't have the range or charging speed of a Model 3 or Ioniq, but could save you a bunch of money if you just need to go from your garage to work every day. (/u/nzahn1 provided [additional recommendations.](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kxu7oq/firsttime_ev_buyers_guide/muwjzjg/))\n\n# Do your research\nOnce you have a handle on your needs (miles of range, fast charging needs, etc.) you can start to actually look into cars. If you are new to EVs, you should contact a dealer and test drive one, ASAP. Doesn't even matter what kind, just go and try it. You'll never forget the first time you put the pedal to the floor in a Hyundai and it accelerates like a Porsche.  \n\nObviously, you'll have your own price range and vehicle preferences, but here's what you should know about the electric side of things. I would recommend starting with a filter for range and price, and survey which vehicles are in your budget that meet your needs. Give yourself a shortlist and then start to think about your particular use case, considering the following: \n\n\n* Maximum fast charging speed (sometimes called DCFC speed): Ignore this if you only plan on charging at home, because it determines your maximum speed at a fast charger. Usually given in kilowatts (kW) or alternatively described by \"10% to 80% charge time\", this is the *peak* charging rate. A number of 50 kW is almost unbearably low (60+ minutes to recharge), while 150 is solid and 200+ is as fast as they come (<20 minutes to recharge). This stat is not standardized so it has to be individually researched for each model you're interested in, and it's worth keeping in mind that it's a *maximum* value, which is affected by things like temperature and how many other people are charging. One thing that might be helpful is to go on PlugShare and check out the specific charging stations you expect to use. The app encourages \"check-ins\" from real users where they report their vehicle information as well as how their charge went. \n\n* \"Fuel\" efficiency: For ICE vehicles, miles per gallon (MPG) is a useful metric for showing the cost of running the vehicle. It's somewhat less important for EVs because electricity is generally cheaper than gas, but can be valuable information to know. Unfortunately, there are 3 metrics for this in EVs right now that all represent the same thing. Here's the short version: MPGe is an attempt to bridge the gap between gas and electric, so the raw number is mostly meaningless for anything besides comparison. Bigger number is better, typically above 100 MPGe. Miles per kilowatt-hour (mi/kWh) is my favorite, since it's just miles/gallon but swapped to the common unit for electric energy. Bigger is better, and numbers range from ~2 for trucks and go up to ~5 for efficient sedans. You can invert it and get kWh/mi, and since this is a decimal it's often shown as kWh/100 miles. For this, *smaller* is better, and numbers range from 20 to 50. Vehicle-specific subreddits are usually a good source of people reporting their numbers, although be aware that people tend to self-report their good numbers more than their bad ones. \n\n* Understand what the \"range\" number means practically: EVs are more efficient in the city than on the highway, by a significant margin. This is because EVs are more affected by aerodynamics, and going faster will steadily eat into your range. Most \"highway range\" numbers are given for fairly conservative speeds of 65-70 mph, so if you want to go 80, you'll shrink your range (conversely, EV drivers will commonly \"extend\" their range if needed by simply going slower). Electric motors and batteries also get less efficient in the cold, by like 20-30%. Combined, this means that a car with 300 miles of advertised range will get an absolute maximum of ~200 miles of range in cold weather, and that's if you're charging to 100% and driving it down to 0%. Rain, wind, and snow are also killers for aerodynamic reasons. Good practice is to just cut the advertised number in half if you plan to do winter road trips and want to know the most reliable, practical range. Elevation and weather are also usually important. I recommend finding YouTube \"range tests\" of the type of car you want. There are tons of these online. \n\n* Full Self-Driving (FSD) capability: This is worth a mention basically because of Tesla, although other automakers are starting to offer some functionality, and the EV customer base makes for a good \"early adopter\" test market. It can be a very attractive feature, especially if you do a lot of driving. For reviews, I would watch some videos on your specific model or go to the vehicle-specific subreddit and ask around. This one is also really important to evaluate in a test drive. \n\n* Plug type: This is last because it's less important, since adapters exist, but you should know if the vehicle you want uses the NACS (also known as SAE J3400) or CCS plug type (SAE J1772). In the US in 2023, Tesla convinced everyone to adopt theirs as standard, which definitely won't be annoying for anyone. Starting in 2025, many new vehicles will be releasing with this plug type, and from 2026 on, most manufacturers that I'm aware of have committed to it exclusively (within the US). If you see a \"CHAdeMO\" plug type, run away; CHAdeMO isn't real, it can't hurt you. ^^Just ^^kidding ^^the ^^Leaf ^^is ^^fine, ^^just ^^kind ^^of ^^outdated ^^at ^^this ^^point. \n\n# How to charge\n\nDuring your vehicle research process, you should also, in parallel, determine how you're going to charge at home. You may already be aware of the different \"levels\": Level 1 charging is a basic wall outlet, Level 2 usually has a dedicated breaker and is basically a high voltage/amperage outlet, like you would get for industrial equipment. Level 3 is DC charging, and these are exclusively for public charging. To give some loose numbers, in order to add 50 miles of range, Level 1 takes 10-15 hours, Level 2 takes 2-5 hours, and level 3 takes less than an hour. \n\n**Many people can get by with basic level 1 charging, and do not need to spend ~$1000 on installing level 2 charging in their home**. Evaluate your daily driving, and how long your vehicle is parked at home. You still might want level 2 charging if you do anything that adds big spikes of driving into your schedule. It sucks to get back from a road trip and stress that you won't be charged enough to get to work the next day, or to leave for a road trip and *not* be at 100% because you charged too slow. \n\nIf your garage doesn't have electric hookups or your breaker box is in a weird spot in your basement or something, it will become quite expensive to install level 2 charging. Usually, it costs something like $400 for the hardware itself and $200-800 for basic installation. If you want specifics on which chargers are good, consult /r/evcharging. If nothing else, know that you need to ensure your equipment meets certain safety specs, so look for UL or ETL standards under product specs. \n\nEdit: Also, as /u/IM_Oscar_dot_com said, many states and/or utility companies offer incentives to help you set up charging stations in your home. See if you qualify before installation! \n\n# Making the purchase\nOnce you've drilled down on the vehicle you want, there's a few additional considerations that happen when you've fully locked in on the car you want and are ready to buy. \n\n* Tax credits: Although not relevant after Dec. 31 2025, [there are currently federal credits for EVs](https://www.irs.gov/clean-vehicle-tax-credits), both new and used. Read the link if interested, but the three big things you should know are: 1) there are requirements on your income and the vehicle price, 2) There's some other requirements based on the vehicle model year (if used) or country it was manufactured in (if new), and 3) for new vehicles there's a \"lease loophole\" that's fairly easy to take advantage of. Everyone's case is different, so just ask if you have more questions here. Lastly, be careful when shopping, since some dealers will incorporate the tax cut into the advertised price (assuming you qualify for the income requirements), while some do not. \n\n* General trends with EV sales (May, 2025): The big thing right now is that depreciation on EVs is relatively high compared to the rest of the car market (and doubly so for Teslas). Importantly, this is not for technical reasons. EV [battery degradation is minimal](https://www.geotab.com/blog/ev-battery-health/), electric motors are theoretically more reliable than gas with fewer moving parts, and 94% of people who have an EV plan to stay with EVs. However, EVs still occupy a bit of an \"early adopter\" niche, so the people who want them are more likely to buy new. Long story short - lease or buy a gently used vehicle for the best bang for your buck. But, like, I'm not your dad or anything, do what you want. \n\n* Test drive: Do not buy your first EV without a significant test drive. If you've done your research well, you'll likely know more about the vehicle than the sales rep. Try out different levels of regenerative braking. Sit with the tech interface for a bit, and see if anything pops out as annoying. Try the self-driving. If there are different drive modes, give them a test. Most people dislike one-pedal driving at first but fall in love with it later, so just leave that off if you can. Also, after driving it for 10-15 minutes, look at what the range is projecting and the current battery percentage. Use those numbers to get the range at 100%, and see how that stacks up with your expectations. This isn't 100% reliable, but it can be used for a quick check. \n\n#Common courtesies\n\n/u/polymath-nc made a good point about EV common courtesy things. Like at a busy gas station, it's polite to move your car as soon as its done pumping. For EVs, there's a few other things that might not be obvious to you: \n\n* Don't charge to 100% at a DCFC charger, especially if there are others waiting. They slow down dramatically as the car approaches 100%, so you're just you're just wasting everyone's time (including yourself!). It's always going to be faster to drive down to <10% and then charge until the charging slows down (usually ~80%). \n\n* If you have a relatively slow charging vehicle (Bolt is a common example with a max speed of 50 kW), you should be considerate when using fast chargers. If you have a choice between a 100 kW charger and a 350 kW charger, it won't make any difference to you which you use, while an Ioniq will take twice as long to charge at the 100 kW charger. \n\n* CHAdeMO plugs are relatively rare and often included as a second cable on a CCS charger. If you've got a CCS/NACS vehicle, treat it like the handicapped stall in the bathroom (they are using CHAdeMO after all), where you should use it only if the other chargers are full. \n\n* Many Supercharger stations have short cords because they were optimized for Teslas, meaning that non-Teslas might have to take up two spaces to connect to their vehicle. If they can (again, handicapped stall logic), Tesla users should leave the end spots open to minimize this, and non-Tesla users should use those end spots rather than take up two spaces.\n\n# Thanks for reading!\n\nHopefully this helps someone!

15760}], "text": "First-Time EV Buyer's Guide\nI often help people on the weekly General Questions and Purchasing Advice thread, and have been thinking about doing something like this to compile my answers to common questions. I'm going to structure it like a guide for each part of the buying process, but it's more like a collection of my thoughts. I'd be happy to add to it if anyone has anything else to contribute! This is also US-centric (sorry). \n\n#The Starting Line\nSo you want to buy an EV eh? Awesome! The process is, in general, very similar to buying a standard internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle, but with a few key additional areas of research. I'm going to assume you generally know the basics of ICE vehicle ownership, and make this guide as specific as possible the electric portion of the vehicle purchasing. \n\nLet me say this up top though if you are on the fence for an EV. If you can charge at home and have a two-car (or more) household, you 100% should make one of those cars an EV. You'll save money on gas and oil changes, and experience the convenience of leaving home with a full \"tank\" every morning. You can get a used Chevy Bolt or Tesla for less than $10k almost anywhere in the US if you qualify for the $4k tax credit, and they're great vehicles that can completely cover 99% of driving needs (and obviously there's plenty of vehicles at higher prices). If that's all you need to hear, go for it. \n\n# Assess your situation\nAs always you should buy a car that suits your needs. Trucks for construction work, vans for families, etc. EVs are no different, but you should ask yourself a few additional questions to determine which, if any, EV is right for you: \n\n* The first, most important question - do you have a place to charge? The main benefit EV owners cite is that the vehicle can \"refuel\" at home, every night. In contrast, the \"worst\" part of the experience is public charging. Even for Superchargers, which are widely considered the most reliable and easiest to use network, charging takes longer than refueling with gas and almost always eliminates any cost savings from getting rid of gas. It's less common, but you can also 100% get by if you charge at work or a public area like a shopping center you regularly visit. \n* What's your normal daily mileage? How much battery do you need? Almost all full battery-powered EVs (BEVs) have >200 miles of range at this point. You could even look at plug-in hybrid EV (PHEVs) if you fit the specific use-case for it (short daily use, home charging, and regular longer road trips) although having a more complex vehicle that retains all the maintenance of a gas engine is, for many, too much of a drawback when BEVs are becoming so capable. \n* Do you plan to use this vehicle to regularly travel to a certain destination more than 100 miles away? Like a weekend ski trip or family in another state? You can use apps like plugshare or A Better Route Planner (ABRP) to plot out these trips and see what public charging is available. Almost nowhere in the US is completely inaccessible to EVs anymore, but some places are much less convenient. \n* Another way to ask the previous question is: do you have another vehicle in your household? A gas vehicle is, in 99% of cases, indisputably better for long distance travel compared to an EV. If you decide that your vehicle will only ever charge at home (outside of emergencies), you can completely ignore fast charging rates, which are relatively difficult to research and understand. \n* There are [calculators](https://afdc.energy.gov/calc/) online to [determine](https://chooseev.com/savings-calculator/) how much [you'll save](https://chargevc.org/ev-calculator/) on fuel by switching to electric. It obviously depends heavily on your particular situation, but rule of thumb is (assuming you charge at home) you'll spend 1/3 of what you spent on gas ($1500 in a year -> $500 in a year), and you'll have minimal maintenance costs. I will say that if money is very tight, you'll find the best value in optimizing your purchase for your needs. A used Bolt, Leaf, or eGolf from the late 2010s won't have the range or charging speed of a Model 3 or Ioniq, but could save you a bunch of money if you just need to go from your garage to work every day. (/u/nzahn1 provided [additional recommendations.](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kxu7oq/firsttime_ev_buyers_guide/muwjzjg/))\n\n# Do your research\nOnce you have a handle on your needs (miles of range, fast charging needs, etc.) you can start to actually look into cars. If you are new to EVs, you should contact a dealer and test drive one, ASAP. Doesn't even matter what kind, just go and try it. You'll never forget the first time you put the pedal to the floor in a Hyundai and it accelerates like a Porsche.  \n\nObviously, you'll have your own price range and vehicle preferences, but here's what you should know about the electric side of things. I would recommend starting with a filter for range and price, and survey which vehicles are in your budget that meet your needs. Give yourself a shortlist and then start to think about your particular use case, considering the following: \n\n\n* Maximum fast charging speed (sometimes called DCFC speed): Ignore this if you only plan on charging at home, because it determines your maximum speed at a fast charger. Usually given in kilowatts (kW) or alternatively described by \"10% to 80% charge time\", this is the *peak* charging rate. A number of 50 kW is almost unbearably low (60+ minutes to recharge), while 150 is solid and 200+ is as fast as they come (<20 minutes to recharge). This stat is not standardized so it has to be individually researched for each model you're interested in, and it's worth keeping in mind that it's a *maximum* value, which is affected by things like temperature and how many other people are charging. One thing that might be helpful is to go on PlugShare and check out the specific charging stations you expect to use. The app encourages \"check-ins\" from real users where they report their vehicle information as well as how their charge went. \n\n* \"Fuel\" efficiency: For ICE vehicles, miles per gallon (MPG) is a useful metric for showing the cost of running the vehicle. It's somewhat less important for EVs because electricity is generally cheaper than gas, but can be valuable information to know. Unfortunately, there are 3 metrics for this in EVs right now that all represent the same thing. Here's the short version: MPGe is an attempt to bridge the gap between gas and electric, so the raw number is mostly meaningless for anything besides comparison. Bigger number is better, typically above 100 MPGe. Miles per kilowatt-hour (mi/kWh) is my favorite, since it's just miles/gallon but swapped to the common unit for electric energy. Bigger is better, and numbers range from ~2 for trucks and go up to ~5 for efficient sedans. You can invert it and get kWh/mi, and since this is a decimal it's often shown as kWh/100 miles. For this, *smaller* is better, and numbers range from 20 to 50. Vehicle-specific subreddits are usually a good source of people reporting their numbers, although be aware that people tend to self-report their good numbers more than their bad ones. \n\n* Understand what the \"range\" number means practically: EVs are more efficient in the city than on the highway, by a significant margin. This is because EVs are more affected by aerodynamics, and going faster will steadily eat into your range. Most \"highway range\" numbers are given for fairly conservative speeds of 65-70 mph, so if you want to go 80, you'll shrink your range (conversely, EV drivers will commonly \"extend\" their range if needed by simply going slower). Electric motors and batteries also get less efficient in the cold, by like 20-30%. Combined, this means that a car with 300 miles of advertised range will get an absolute maximum of ~200 miles of range in cold weather, and that's if you're charging to 100% and driving it down to 0%. Rain, wind, and snow are also killers for aerodynamic reasons. Good practice is to just cut the advertised number in half if you plan to do winter road trips and want to know the most reliable, practical range. Elevation and weather are also usually important. I recommend finding YouTube \"range tests\" of the type of car you want. There are tons of these online. \n\n* Full Self-Driving (FSD) capability: This is worth a mention basically because of Tesla, although other automakers are starting to offer some functionality, and the EV customer base makes for a good \"early adopter\" test market. It can be a very attractive feature, especially if you do a lot of driving. For reviews, I would watch some videos on your specific model or go to the vehicle-specific subreddit and ask around. This one is also really important to evaluate in a test drive. \n\n* Plug type: This is last because it's less important, since adapters exist, but you should know if the vehicle you want uses the NACS (also known as SAE J3400) or CCS plug type (SAE J1772). In the US in 2023, Tesla convinced everyone to adopt theirs as standard, which definitely won't be annoying for anyone. Starting in 2025, many new vehicles will be releasing with this plug type, and from 2026 on, most manufacturers that I'm aware of have committed to it exclusively (within the US). If you see a \"CHAdeMO\" plug type, run away; CHAdeMO isn't real, it can't hurt you. ^^Just ^^kidding ^^the ^^Leaf ^^is ^^fine, ^^just ^^kind ^^of ^^outdated ^^at ^^this ^^point. \n\n# How to charge\n\nDuring your vehicle research process, you should also, in parallel, determine how you're going to charge at home. You may already be aware of the different \"levels\": Level 1 charging is a basic wall outlet, Level 2 usually has a dedicated breaker and is basically a high voltage/amperage outlet, like you would get for industrial equipment. Level 3 is DC charging, and these are exclusively for public charging. To give some loose numbers, in order to add 50 miles of range, Level 1 takes 10-15 hours, Level 2 takes 2-5 hours, and level 3 takes less than an hour. \n\n**Many people can get by with basic level 1 charging, and do not need to spend ~$1000 on installing level 2 charging in their home**. Evaluate your daily driving, and how long your vehicle is parked at home. You still might want level 2 charging if you do anything that adds big spikes of driving into your schedule. It sucks to get back from a road trip and stress that you won't be charged enough to get to work the next day, or to leave for a road trip and *not* be at 100% because you charged too slow. \n\nIf your garage doesn't have electric hookups or your breaker box is in a weird spot in your basement or something, it will become quite expensive to install level 2 charging. Usually, it costs something like $400 for the hardware itself and $200-800 for basic installation. If you want specifics on which chargers are good, consult /r/evcharging. If nothing else, know that you need to ensure your equipment meets certain safety specs, so look for UL or ETL standards under product specs. \n\nEdit: Also, as /u/IM_Oscar_dot_com said, many states and/or utility companies offer incentives to help you set up charging stations in your home. See if you qualify before installation! \n\n# Making the purchase\nOnce you've drilled down on the vehicle you want, there's a few additional considerations that happen when you've fully locked in on the car you want and are ready to buy. \n\n* Tax credits: Although not relevant after Dec. 31 2025, [there are currently federal credits for EVs](https://www.irs.gov/clean-vehicle-tax-credits), both new and used. Read the link if interested, but the three big things you should know are: 1) there are requirements on your income and the vehicle price, 2) There's some other requirements based on the vehicle model year (if used) or country it was manufactured in (if new), and 3) for new vehicles there's a \"lease loophole\" that's fairly easy to take advantage of. Everyone's case is different, so just ask if you have more questions here. Lastly, be careful when shopping, since some dealers will incorporate the tax cut into the advertised price (assuming you qualify for the income requirements), while some do not. \n\n* General trends with EV sales (May, 2025): The big thing right now is that depreciation on EVs is relatively high compared to the rest of the car market (and doubly so for Teslas). Importantly, this is not for technical reasons. EV [battery degradation is minimal](https://www.geotab.com/blog/ev-battery-health/), electric motors are theoretically more reliable than gas with fewer moving parts, and 94% of people who have an EV plan to stay with EVs. However, EVs still occupy a bit of an \"early adopter\" niche, so the people who want them are more likely to buy new. Long story short - lease or buy a gently used vehicle for the best bang for your buck. But, like, I'm not your dad or anything, do what you want. \n\n* Test drive: Do not buy your first EV without a significant test drive. If you've done your research well, you'll likely know more about the vehicle than the sales rep. Try out different levels of regenerative braking. Sit with the tech interface for a bit, and see if anything pops out as annoying. Try the self-driving. If there are different drive modes, give them a test. Most people dislike one-pedal driving at first but fall in love with it later, so just leave that off if you can. Also, after driving it for 10-15 minutes, look at what the range is projecting and the current battery percentage. Use those numbers to get the range at 100%, and see how that stacks up with your expectations. This isn't 100% reliable, but it can be used for a quick check. \n\n#Common courtesies\n\n/u/polymath-nc made a good point about EV common courtesy things. Like at a busy gas station, it's polite to move your car as soon as its done pumping. For EVs, there's a few other things that might not be obvious to you: \n\n* Don't charge to 100% at a DCFC charger, especially if there are others waiting. They slow down dramatically as the car approaches 100%, so you're just you're just wasting everyone's time (including yourself!). It's always going to be faster to drive down to <10% and then charge until the charging slows down (usually ~80%). \n\n* If you have a relatively slow charging vehicle (Bolt is a common example with a max speed of 50 kW), you should be considerate when using fast chargers. If you have a choice between a 100 kW charger and a 350 kW charger, it won't make any difference to you which you use, while an Ioniq will take twice as long to charge at the 100 kW charger. \n\n* CHAdeMO plugs are relatively rare and often included as a second cable on a CCS charger. If you've got a CCS/NACS vehicle, treat it like the handicapped stall in the bathroom (they are using CHAdeMO after all), where you should use it only if the other chargers are full. \n\n* Many Supercharger stations have short cords because they were optimized for Teslas, meaning that non-Teslas might have to take up two spaces to connect to their vehicle. If they can (again, handicapped stall logic), Tesla users should leave the end spots open to minimize this, and non-Tesla users should use those end spots rather than take up two spaces.\n\n# Thanks for reading!\n\nHopefully this helps someone! Please feel free to leave a comment or suggest anything. If there's advice from non-US sources, I'd be happy to include it. If you're someone reading this in the future, please feel free to ask your question directly. If it's a specific \"should I buy this car\" request, be sure to give detailed information about your location, driving needs, budget, etc. \n\nEdited in the first few comments.

Also it's much easier to implement battery swapping for buses than cars. Also in motion charging with trolley bus wires too is possible.\n\nThen we come to resource consumption for cars vs public transportation. Let's take battery needed for electrification. Shenzen has a 100% electric bus fleet. An electric bus would mostly have 500 kWh battery pack. This can be reduced below 100 kWh by opportunity charging (like pantograph charging or battery swapping). Let's be conservative and assume you need 500 kWh battery per bus. And there is one bus per 500 residents in Shenzen. So it comes down to only 625 Wh/person. If they owned cars they would need atleast 15,000 Wh/person assuming one car with 60 kWh battery per a family of 4. This can go upto 60,000 Wh/person or even higher if there's one car per person.\n\nYou can also use trolley buses for very busy bus routes. Which would only need a very small battery.\n\nThen the amount of infrastructure needed. One metro line with 2 track (1+1) can transportore people than a 100 lane road (50+50). One dedicated bus lane can transport more people than 6-8 lanes of cars. One cycle lane can transport as much people as a 6 lanes of cars.\n\nImagine how much land we can conserve with electric trains and buses as opposed to cars.\n\nThen we come to affordability. As said earlier 99% of indian railways and 75% of Chinese railways are already electrified. So I don't think 99% of Indians can afford Teslas or any other electric car brands. But they can definitely afford those trains. China for example has 40,000 km of electrified highspeed railways. And 11,000 km of electricetro railways. \n\nThen comes life quality. From Beijing to Shanghai it takes only 4 hours and 15 minutes by highspeed trains. It takes a lot more time on an electric car.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zYJPOZbhXTA?si=9mriiHBIwzWDWZzG\n\nAnd let's see how much permanent magnets does electric trains vs cars consume. An electric car has 200 kW to 300 kW motor. And they can transport at maximum 4 people comfortably. So 50 to 75 kW of motor per passneger. \n\nEven highspeed trains like N700 shinkansen can transport 1323 people with only 17,080 kW motor power. So it comes down to only 12 kW per passeger.

{"author_id": "1nh1saemb8", "author_name": "blr1g", "body": "To be completely honest, I've had a PHEV for 5 years, and an Ioniq 6 for the past 2 years. We just drive the PHEV for our long road trips. I just picked up a new Ioniq 5 for a 3 year lease. I took a plane to Los Angeles, and decided to take a two day road trip through the Hwy 395 to Mammoth Lakes to Sonora Rd. In the 25 years of living in California, this is the first time I've ever been to Mammoth Lakes or have driven the 395, and it's something I've been wanting to do forever. I drove over 600 miles in two days, and this is why I don't think I'll ever do a road trip again in an EV.\n\nMain reason? Costs. Nearly every fast charger, including the new Tesla Supercharger network, all costed about 64 cents / kWh. Some were even more expensive at 90 cents / kWh (WTF??). I was thinking the new Supercharger network would be cheaper. I see prices in the Bay Area for about 43 cents. Which isn't that bad. But, what I didn't realize is that these are for OFF peak hours, and only for Tesla vehicles.\n\nAt 64 cents / kWh, I estimated that if I had just driven a regular Rav4 Hybrid vs the Ioniq 5 (which averaged 3.9 miles / kWh efficiency for the entire trip, supposedly), I would have spent an extra $31 just to charge the EV compared to $4.40 / gallon of gas for the Rav4. And, not to mention the time it takes to charge.\n\nI estimated that it took me about 35 minutes the first day to get off the road and charge at an EA charger. There was luckily a free 50 kw charger on a rest stop I pulled over after wards, and I stopped for about 15 minutes to charge and use the restroom. This was a good thing because that extra kWh helped me with some range anxiety I had while I started driving into the mountains.\n\nI didn't realize how high Mammoth Lakes would be, but the elevation markers as I was climbing some steep grades were showing 6000' then 7000'. My final destination would be at 9000' elevation. During the drive up, I saw my efficiency drop all the way down to around 1.4 mi / kWh. And, that was pretty freaky. But, I figured I had enough range to make it to the town were they had some Superchargers. So, the range anxiety wasn't too bad. But, the next day, I'm really glad I decided to charge before heading into Sonora Rd. (hwy 108).\n\nI had about 80 miles of range (I charged at the hotel before I left) when I got to a small town a few miles before this twisty scenic road called Sonora Rd. I was thinking, ah, I should be fine, since most of this road should be down hill, and I should be able to get a ton of efficiency. But, I figured, better safe than sorry. I pulled up to this EA 350 kw station, and it charged my car at 200 kw for almost 9 minutes. I was like, DAMNNNN that's FAST. What's funny is this old man in a brand new Subaru Solterra was charging next to me at a 150 kw station, and he asked if it would charge faster on the 350 kw. I said, \"Definitely not for your car. Your car is limited to 150 kw max.\" I looked at his charging stats, and at 49% SOC, his car was only charging at 54 kw! LMAO! Wow, no wonder those BZ4x's totally bombed.\n\nI got up to 70% and figured it's time to go. I'm SO glad I did that charge, because I did not realize that the first 20 or 30 miles of the drive would be going up to 11,000' My average efficiency for the first 20 miles was about 1.1 mi / kWh. It was this undulating rollercoaster road that kept going up with lots of switchbacks and tight turns. I think if I hadn't charged, I probably would have turned back and went back to town to charge, wasting a ton of time and energy. But, fortunately, after that, the rest of the 60+ miles were all down hill. By the time I got to Sonora, my efficiency was something like 25 mi / kWh.\n\nAll this is to say that road tripping with an EV is expensive, and a bit time consuming. We do a huge 2400 mile road trip every year to Canada and back, and in our Rav4 Prime, there is no headaches, no range anxiety, and gas is cheap along the way. We don't take super long rest stops. 10 minutes is more than enough time for us to pull over, get gas, use the rest room, and do whatever else like take the dog out.

{"author_id": "gg96nz9z5", "author_name": "user10515", "body": "I want this to be a healthy discussion and not drift sideways. I just bought a 2026 Tesla Model Y Juniper, my first Tesla, and after only a few days of ownership I’m honestly blown away by what it offers for the price.\n\nFor context, my previous car was a 2022 Chevy Bolt EUV. That car was fine for what I paid, about $26,000 after the 2021 tax credit. It got me from point A to point B without trouble, but it was basic. Before ordering the Tesla, I spent real time with other new EVs to make sure I was being fair.\n\nThe first was a fully loaded 2026 Chevy Blazer EV with the Super Cruise package. I put about 280 miles on it and came away extremely unimpressed. The Google-based infotainment system is laggy, freezes randomly, and doesn’t have many apps to download from. Apple Music worked, but iPhone integration was clunky. You have to carry a key fob because there is no phone-as-key option. There is no integrated dashcam to record accidents or incidents.\n\nI contacted at least 5 different people in the GM EV Concierge department, including supervisors, and nobody could tell me whether my vehicle had a feature or how to verify or enable it. Super Cruise was the biggest disappointment. Even on mapped highways in perfect weather, it constantly disengaged with “take over now” warnings. On several occasions, it drifted toward the center of a two-lane highway before handing control back, which felt unsafe and made me lose trust in the system. GM’s ads claiming it’s the best driver-assist system? Not even close.\n\nNext, I spent a few days in a friend’s 2025 Ford Mustang Mach-E with Blue Cruise. BlueCruise felt sharper and more confident than Super Cruise, and I trusted it more to stay centered. But the limited mapped-road coverage meant frequent disengagements that became annoying on longer trips. The infotainment system was faster and supported CarPlay and Android Auto, which made daily use easier, but it still felt like a half step behind what Tesla offers.\n\nThen I drove my Model Y. Night and day. I can unlock and drive away using my phone or Apple Watch, and if those are unavailable I can use a simple key card. Driver profiles are a game changer: the car recognizes my wife as she approaches and automatically sets her mirrors, seat, steering wheel, climate controls, and signs her into her music apps. Sentry Mode and the integrated dashcam record possible hit-and-run events or anyone lingering near the car and notify me through the app. Supercharging is effortless. I simply pull up, plug in, and it charges without creating accounts with a dozen different networks. The rear seats fold down and back up at the push of a button, and the interior is roomy and comfortable.\n\nThe delivery process alone shows how different Tesla is. I ordered online, scheduled pickup, and avoided dealership games and ridiculous add-ons like nitrogen tire air, $300 wheel locks, or the $600 “opticam” pitch. Other dealers tried to add nearly $3,000 in unnecessary extras. Because of older YouTube videos and forum posts about panel gaps and paint defects, I arrived with a 50-point delivery checklist, expecting problems. I was shocked to find nothing out of place. The panels were aligned, the paint was perfect, and everything worked exactly as it should. Tesla’s build quality has clearly improved compared with the issues reported in earlier years.\n\nFor under $40,000 after the federal tax credit, the Model Y delivers technology, convenience, and performance that GM and Ford simply do not match today. After driving FSD, going back to Super Cruise or BlueCruise feels like a huge step backward. The Bolt EUV was a good budget EV, but the 2026 Blazer EV and Mach-E do not justify their $50,000-plus price tags given software and driver-assist shortcomings.

I just bought a 2026 Tesla Model Y Juniper, my first Tesla, and after only a few days of ownership I’m honestly blown away by what it offers for the price.\n\nFor context, my previous car was a 2022 Chevy Bolt EUV. That car was fine for what I paid, about $26,000 after the 2021 tax credit. It got me from point A to point B without trouble, but it was basic. Before ordering the Tesla, I spent real time with other new EVs to make sure I was being fair.\n\nThe first was a fully loaded 2026 Chevy Blazer EV with the Super Cruise package. I put about 280 miles on it and came away extremely unimpressed. The Google-based infotainment system is laggy, freezes randomly, and doesn’t have many apps to download from. Apple Music worked, but iPhone integration was clunky. You have to carry a key fob because there is no phone-as-key option. There is no integrated dashcam to record accidents or incidents.\n\nI contacted at least 5 different people in the GM EV Concierge department, including supervisors, and nobody could tell me whether my vehicle had a feature or how to verify or enable it. Super Cruise was the biggest disappointment. Even on mapped highways in perfect weather, it constantly disengaged with “take over now” warnings. On several occasions, it drifted toward the center of a two-lane highway before handing control back, which felt unsafe and made me lose trust in the system. GM’s ads claiming it’s the best driver-assist system? Not even close.\n\nNext, I spent a few days in a friend’s 2025 Ford Mustang Mach-E with Blue Cruise. BlueCruise felt sharper and more confident than Super Cruise, and I trusted it more to stay centered. But the limited mapped-road coverage meant frequent disengagements that became annoying on longer trips. The infotainment system was faster and supported CarPlay and Android Auto, which made daily use easier, but it still felt like a half step behind what Tesla offers.\n\nThen I drove my Model Y. Night and day. I can unlock and drive away using my phone or Apple Watch, and if those are unavailable I can use a simple key card. Driver profiles are a game changer: the car recognizes my wife as she approaches and automatically sets her mirrors, seat, steering wheel, climate controls, and signs her into her music apps. Sentry Mode and the integrated dashcam record possible hit-and-run events or anyone lingering near the car and notify me through the app. Supercharging is effortless. I simply pull up, plug in, and it charges without creating accounts with a dozen different networks. The rear seats fold down and back up at the push of a button, and the interior is roomy and comfortable.\n\nThe delivery process alone shows how different Tesla is. I ordered online, scheduled pickup, and avoided dealership games and ridiculous add-ons like nitrogen tire air, $300 wheel locks, or the $600 “opticam” pitch. Other dealers tried to add nearly $3,000 in unnecessary extras. Because of older YouTube videos and forum posts about panel gaps and paint defects, I arrived with a 50-point delivery checklist, expecting problems. I was shocked to find nothing out of place. The panels were aligned, the paint was perfect, and everything worked exactly as it should. Tesla’s build quality has clearly improved compared with the issues reported in earlier years.\n\nFor under $40,000 after the federal tax credit, the Model Y delivers technology, convenience, and performance that GM and Ford simply do not match today. After driving FSD, going back to Super Cruise or BlueCruise feels like a huge step backward. The Bolt EUV was a good budget EV, but the 2026 Blazer EV and Mach-E do not justify their $50,000-plus price tags given software and driver-assist shortcomings. Tesla is the benchmark in electric vehicles and the most valuable automaker in the world for a reason. I cannot speak for Rivian, BYD, Kia, or Hyundai yet, but if today’s market is any indication GM and Ford need to step up their game.

{"author_id": "9qit77c6", "author_name": "exmothrowaway994", "body": "I live with a very limited electricity connection (two people living off of a single outlet) and it doesn't look like that will change soon. I've been thinking about selling my current car and getting an EV that is capable of discharging power and moving the stuff that is only powered when I'm home over to that. \n\nI'd like, as much as possible, to provide my own power. The best way I see to do that is get a gas generator, pump all the power generated from that into the car, and use that to power my room and get me to and from work. Is this sort of plan viable, or is there a better alternative? Is there something I've overlooked or am unaware of?\n\nEdit for clarifications: \n\n1) when I say single outlet, all the power for our property comes from an extension cord to my neighbors circuit breaker. He is aware of it, and we pay him. For reasons I don't want to go into, the local power company refuses to connect us. \n\n2) I want to get an EV instead of just using a generator because, as I understand it, when a generator is running it is making a constant amount of electricity. Any electricity made is either used or wasted. If we just used a generator, we would basically never use the full capacity and thus waste a lot of gas. A large stationary battery would work, but since I also need to get around why not sell my gas car and just ride the battery?\n\n3) I'd like to do solar as well, but we don't have any places I'd feel safe putting the panels. The only \"permanent\" structure is a 40 ft sheet metal shed the prior owner built himself, and the permanently stationary RV we live in.\n\nAlso, my interest in an EV specifically is more than just for this batshit setup. I have a combustion engine vehicle, and I am thinking about selling it.

I've been thinking about selling my current car and getting an EV that is capable of discharging power and moving the stuff that is only powered when I'm home over to that. \n\nI'd like, as much as possible, to provide my own power. The best way I see to do that is get a gas generator, pump all the power generated from that into the car, and use that to power my room and get me to and from work. Is this sort of plan viable, or is there a better alternative? Is there something I've overlooked or am unaware of?\n\nEdit for clarifications: \n\n1) when I say single outlet, all the power for our property comes from an extension cord to my neighbors circuit breaker. He is aware of it, and we pay him. For reasons I don't want to go into, the local power company refuses to connect us. \n\n2) I want to get an EV instead of just using a generator because, as I understand it, when a generator is running it is making a constant amount of electricity. Any electricity made is either used or wasted. If we just used a generator, we would basically never use the full capacity and thus waste a lot of gas. A large stationary battery would work, but since I also need to get around why not sell my gas car and just ride the battery?\n\n3) I'd like to do solar as well, but we don't have any places I'd feel safe putting the panels. The only \"permanent\" structure is a 40 ft sheet metal shed the prior owner built himself, and the permanently stationary RV we live in.\n\nAlso, my interest in an EV specifically is more than just for this batshit setup. I have a combustion engine vehicle, and I am thinking about selling it.

I can add 3 miles of range with my brain in about 5 minutes, doing it with the Jackery would take an hour.  \n\nAlso redefine battery zero in your mind,  i define it as indicated 10%, but if I'm in bow-and-arrow country I'll redefine it as 30-40%.  \n\nLearn all about 120V and 240V plugs, and bring mobile chargers and alllllll the adapters.   Electricity is the most available commodity on planet earth.  Easier to find than potable water. But if you don't have any kit, you can't use it.  BTDT.", "title": "", "url": ""}

{"author_id": "ioq7sr4nm", "author_name": "muegle", "body": "> I believe the newer Mach Es max out at 150kW, not sure where 250kW came from in your research.\n\nYou're correct on the Mach E. Teslas (not including cybertruck) are 400V architecture vehicles and can go up to about 250kW at superchargers. But there's a key difference.

I mean the Rivian is in another price class entirely, and is the specific vehicle I was thinking of where it’s “not efficient” so you can pour power into one faster then 200kW from a 400V DC charger, but it also I think you need about twice as many kWh to go a mile as the EV6.  I also find the Rivian much more comfortable then a EV6.  Plus I can fit my wife, 4 dogs, and a fair bit of luggage inside if the “road trip” is “week long beach vacation”, although I may regret letting on of my dogs decide he needs to be in a crate in the back because he doesn’t want to share space (or snacks) with 2 of the other 3 dogs.\n\nI think many or all Lucids have a range over 319 (some significantly so), but again they are in another price class.\n\nI’m not at all saying the EV6 isn’t a good road tripper, just that the advantages of 800V may be overstated a bit, and may not pan out in the real world as super important on many routes.\n\nHell on a road trip I would prefer an EV I own to one that is “better on paper” because I’m already familiar with the quirks of one I own.  If I have to get use to a brand new vehicle I might make some sort of mistake I’ll regret.

I mean the Rivian is in another price class entirely, and is the specific vehicle I was thinking of where it’s “not efficient” so you can pour power into one faster then 200kW from a 400V DC charger, but it also I think you need about twice as many kWh to go a mile as the EV6.  I also find the Rivian much more comfortable then a EV6.  Plus I can fit my wife, 4 dogs, and a fair bit of luggage inside if the “road trip” is “week long beach vacation”, although I may regret letting on of my dogs decide he needs to be in a crate in the back because he doesn’t want to share space (or snacks) with 2 of the other 3 dogs.\n\nI think many or all Lucids have a range over 319 (some significantly so), but again they are in another price class.\n\nI’m not at all saying the EV6 isn’t a good road tripper, just that the advantages of 800V may be overstated a bit, and may not pan out in the real world as super important on many routes.\n\nHell on a road trip I would prefer an EV I own to one that is “better on paper” because I’m already familiar with the quirks of one I own.
