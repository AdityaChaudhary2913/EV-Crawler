I often help people on the weekly General Questions and Purchasing Advice thread, and have been thinking about doing something like this to compile my answers to common questions. I'm going to structure it like a guide for each part of the buying process, but it's more like a collection of my thoughts. I'd be happy to add to it if anyone has anything else to contribute! This is also US-centric (sorry). 

#The Starting Line
So you want to buy an EV eh? Awesome! The process is, in general, very similar to buying a standard internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle, but with a few key additional areas of research. I'm going to assume you generally know the basics of ICE vehicle ownership, and make this guide as specific as possible the electric portion of the vehicle purchasing. 

Let me say this up top though if you are on the fence for an EV. If you can charge at home and have a two-car (or more) household, you 100% should make one of those cars an EV. You'll save money on gas and oil changes, and experience the convenience of leaving home with a full ""tank"" every morning. You can get a used Chevy Bolt or Tesla for less than $10k almost anywhere in the US if you qualify for the $4k tax credit, and they're great vehicles that can completely cover 99% of driving needs (and obviously there's plenty of vehicles at higher prices). If that's all you need to hear, go for it. 

# Assess your situation
As always you should buy a car that suits your needs. Trucks for construction work, vans for families, etc. EVs are no different, but you should ask yourself a few additional questions to determine which, if any, EV is right for you: 

* The first, most important question - do you have a place to charge? The main benefit EV owners cite is that the vehicle can ""refuel"" at home, every night. In contrast, the ""worst"" part of the experience is public charging. Even for Superchargers, which are widely considered the most reliable and easiest to use network, charging takes longer than refueling with gas and almost always eliminates any cost savings from getting rid of gas. It's less common, but you can also 100% get by if you charge at work or a public area like a shopping center you regularly visit. 
* What's your normal daily mileage? How much battery do you need? Almost all full battery-powered EVs (BEVs) have >200 miles of range at this point. You could even look at plug-in hybrid EV (PHEVs) if you fit the specific use-case for it (short daily use, home charging, and regular longer road trips) although having a more complex vehicle that retains all the maintenance of a gas engine is, for many, too much of a drawback when BEVs are becoming so capable. 
* Do you plan to use this vehicle to regularly travel to a certain destination more than 100 miles away? Like a weekend ski trip or family in another state? You can use apps like plugshare or A Better Route Planner (ABRP) to plot out these trips and see what public charging is available. Almost nowhere in the US is completely inaccessible to EVs anymore, but some places are much less convenient. 
* Another way to ask the previous question is: do you have another vehicle in your household? A gas vehicle is, in 99% of cases, indisputably better for long distance travel compared to an EV. If you decide that your vehicle will only ever charge at home (outside of emergencies), you can completely ignore fast charging rates, which are relatively difficult to research and understand. 
* There are [calculators](https://afdc.energy.gov/calc/) online to [determine](https://chooseev.com/savings-calculator/) how much [you'll save](https://chargevc.org/ev-calculator/) on fuel by switching to electric. It obviously depends heavily on your particular situation, but rule of thumb is (assuming you charge at home) you'll spend 1/3 of what you spent on gas ($1500 in a year -> $500 in a year), and you'll have minimal maintenance costs. I will say that if money is very tight, you'll find the best value in optimizing your purchase for your needs. A used Bolt, Leaf, or eGolf from the late 2010s won't have the range or charging speed of a Model 3 or Ioniq, but could save you a bunch of money if you just need to go from your garage to work every day. (/u/nzahn1 provided [additional recommendations.](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kxu7oq/firsttime_ev_buyers_guide/muwjzjg/))

# Do your research
Once you have a handle on your needs (miles of range, fast charging needs, etc.) you can start to actually look into cars. If you are new to EVs, you should contact a dealer and test drive one, ASAP. Doesn't even matter what kind, just go and try it. You'll never forget the first time you put the pedal to the floor in a Hyundai and it accelerates like a Porsche.  

Obviously, you'll have your own price range and vehicle preferences, but here's what you should know about the electric side of things. I would recommend starting with a filter for range and price, and survey which vehicles are in your budget that meet your needs. Give yourself a shortlist and then start to think about your particular use case, considering the following: 


* Maximum fast charging speed (sometimes called DCFC speed): Ignore this if you only plan on charging at home, because it determines your maximum speed at a fast charger. Usually given in kilowatts (kW) or alternatively described by ""10% to 80% charge time"", this is the *peak* charging rate. A number of 50 kW is almost unbearably low (60+ minutes to recharge), while 150 is solid and 200+ is as fast as they come (<20 minutes to recharge). This stat is not standardized so it has to be individually researched for each model you're interested in, and it's worth keeping in mind that it's a *maximum* value, which is affected by things like temperature and how many other people are charging. One thing that might be helpful is to go on PlugShare and check out the specific charging stations you expect to use. The app encourages ""check-ins"" from real users where they report their vehicle information as well as how their charge went. 

* ""Fuel"" efficiency: For ICE vehicles, miles per gallon (MPG) is a useful metric for showing the cost of running the vehicle. It's somewhat less important for EVs because electricity is generally cheaper than gas, but can be valuable information to know. Unfortunately, there are 3 metrics for this in EVs right now that all represent the same thing. Here's the short version: MPGe is an attempt to bridge the gap between gas and electric, so the raw number is mostly meaningless for anything besides comparison. Bigger number is better, typically above 100 MPGe. Miles per kilowatt-hour (mi/kWh) is my favorite, since it's just miles/gallon but swapped to the common unit for electric energy. Bigger is better, and numbers range from ~2 for trucks and go up to ~5 for efficient sedans. You can invert it and get kWh/mi, and since this is a decimal it's often shown as kWh/100 miles. For this, *smaller* is better, and numbers range from 20 to 50. Vehicle-specific subreddits are usually a good source of people reporting their numbers, although be aware that people tend to self-report their good numbers more than their bad ones. 

* Understand what the ""range"" number means practically: EVs are more efficient in the city than on the highway, by a significant margin. This is because EVs are more affected by aerodynamics, and going faster will steadily eat into your range. Most ""highway range"" numbers are given for fairly conservative speeds of 65-70 mph, so if you want to go 80, you'll shrink your range (conversely, EV drivers will commonly ""extend"" their range if needed by simply going slower). Electric motors and batteries also get less efficient in the cold, by like 20-30%. Combined, this means that a car with 300 miles of advertised range will get an absolute maximum of ~200 miles of range in cold weather, and that's if you're charging to 100% and driving it down to 0%. Rain, wind, and snow are also killers for aerodynamic reasons. Good practice is to just cut the advertised number in half if you plan to do winter road trips and want to know the most reliable, practical range. Elevation and weather are also usually important. I recommend finding YouTube ""range tests"" of the type of car you want. There are tons of these online. 

* Full Self-Driving (FSD) capability: This is worth a mention basically because of Tesla, although other automakers are starting to offer some functionality, and the EV customer base makes for a good ""early adopter"" test market. It can be a very attractive feature, especially if you do a lot of driving. For reviews, I would watch some videos on your specific model or go to the vehicle-specific subreddit and ask around. This one is also really important to evaluate in a test drive. 

* Plug type: This is last because it's less important, since adapters exist, but you should know if the vehicle you want uses the NACS (also known as SAE J3400) or CCS plug type (SAE J1772). In the US in 2023, Tesla convinced everyone to adopt theirs as standard, which definitely won't be annoying for anyone. Starting in 2025, many new vehicles will be releasing with this plug type, and from 2026 on, most manufacturers that I'm aware of have committed to it exclusively (within the US). If you see a ""CHAdeMO"" plug type, run away; CHAdeMO isn't real, it can't hurt you. ^^Just ^^kidding ^^the ^^Leaf ^^is ^^fine, ^^just ^^kind ^^of ^^outdated ^^at ^^this ^^point. 

# How to charge

During your vehicle research process, you should also, in parallel, determine how you're going to charge at home. You may already be aware of the different ""levels"": Level 1 charging is a basic wall outlet, Level 2 usually has a dedicated breaker and is basically a high voltage/amperage outlet, like you would get for industrial equipment. Level 3 is DC charging, and these are exclusively for public charging. To give some loose numbers, in order to add 50 miles of range, Level 1 takes 10-15 hours, Level 2 takes 2-5 hours, and level 3 takes less than an hour. 

**Many people can get by with basic level 1 charging, and do not need to spend ~$1000 on installing level 2 charging in their home**. Evaluate your daily driving, and how long your vehicle is parked at home. You still might want level 2 charging if you do anything that adds big spikes of driving into your schedule. It sucks to get back from a road trip and stress that you won't be charged enough to get to work the next day, or to leave for a road trip and *not* be at 100% because you charged too slow. 

If your garage doesn't have electric hookups or your breaker box is in a weird spot in your basement or something, it will become quite expensive to install level 2 charging. Usually, it costs something like $400 for the hardware itself and $200-800 for basic installation. If you want specifics on which chargers are good, consult /r/evcharging. If nothing else, know that you need to ensure your equipment meets certain safety specs, so look for UL or ETL standards under product specs. 

Edit: Also, as /u/IM_Oscar_dot_com said, many states and/or utility companies offer incentives to help you set up charging stations in your home. See if you qualify before installation! 

# Making the purchase
Once you've drilled down on the vehicle you want, there's a few additional considerations that happen when you've fully locked in on the car you want and are ready to buy. 

* Tax credits: Although not relevant after Dec. 31 2025, [there are currently federal credits for EVs](https://www.irs.gov/clean-vehicle-tax-credits), both new and used. Read the link if interested, but the three big things you should know are: 1) there are requirements on your income and the vehicle price, 2) There's some other requirements based on the vehicle model year (if used) or country it was manufactured in (if new), and 3) for new vehicles there's a ""lease loophole"" that's fairly easy to take advantage of. Everyone's case is different, so just ask if you have more questions here. Lastly, be careful when shopping, since some dealers will incorporate the tax cut into the advertised price (assuming you qualify for the income requirements), while some do not. 

* General trends with EV sales (May, 2025): The big thing right now is that depreciation on EVs is relatively high compared to the rest of the car market (and doubly so for Teslas). Importantly, this is not for technical reasons. EV [battery degradation is minimal](https://www.geotab.com/blog/ev-battery-health/), electric motors are theoretically more reliable than gas with fewer moving parts, and 94% of people who have an EV plan to stay with EVs. However, EVs still occupy a bit of an ""early adopter"" niche, so the people who want them are more likely to buy new. Long story short - lease or buy a gently used vehicle for the best bang for your buck. But, like, I'm not your dad or anything, do what you want. 

* Test drive: Do not buy your first EV without a significant test drive. If you've done your research well, you'll likely know more about the vehicle than the sales rep. Try out different levels of regenerative braking. Sit with the tech interface for a bit, and see if anything pops out as annoying. Try the self-driving. If there are different drive modes, give them a test. Most people dislike one-pedal driving at first but fall in love with it later, so just leave that off if you can. Also, after driving it for 10-15 minutes, look at what the range is projecting and the current battery percentage. Use those numbers to get the range at 100%, and see how that stacks up with your expectations. This isn't 100% reliable, but it can be used for a quick check. 

#Common courtesies

/u/polymath-nc made a good point about EV common courtesy things. Like at a busy gas station, it's polite to move your car as soon as its done pumping. For EVs, there's a few other things that might not be obvious to you: 

* Don't charge to 100% at a DCFC charger, especially if there are others waiting. They slow down dramatically as the car approaches 100%, so you're just you're just wasting everyone's time (including yourself!). It's always going to be faster to drive down to <10% and then charge until the charging slows down (usually ~80%). 

* If you have a relatively slow charging vehicle (Bolt is a common example with a max speed of 50 kW), you should be considerate when using fast chargers. If you have a choice between a 100 kW charger and a 350 kW charger, it won't make any difference to you which you use, while an Ioniq will take twice as long to charge at the 100 kW charger. 

* CHAdeMO plugs are relatively rare and often included as a second cable on a CCS charger. If you've got a CCS/NACS vehicle, treat it like the handicapped stall in the bathroom (they are using CHAdeMO after all), where you should use it only if the other chargers are full. 

* Many Supercharger stations have short cords because they were optimized for Teslas, meaning that non-Teslas might have to take up two spaces to connect to their vehicle. If they can (again, handicapped stall logic), Tesla users should leave the end spots open to minimize this, and non-Tesla users should use those end spots rather than take up two spaces.

**Honda Activa EV Launch in India on Nov 27**  
[https://gaadiwaadi.com/honda-activa-ev-launching-soon-in-india-what-we-know-so-far/](https://gaadiwaadi.com/honda-activa-ev-launching-soon-in-india-what-we-know-so-far/)

Honda is launching its Activa EV, featuring two detachable Mobile Power Pack e: batteries, placed under the seat. These batteries are part of Honda's proprietary system, also used in Japan through Gachaco—a joint venture between Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and ENEOS established in 2022. Gachaco offers battery-swapping services for electric two-wheelers, relying on Honda’s standard Mobile Power Pack e: system.

**Battery Swapping Gains Momentum in India**

Honda's upcoming launch of the Activa EV is set to bring significant attention to battery swapping in India, underlining the vast potential of this market. It also signals the start of a competitive race in a rapidly growing segment. India’s size and demand for affordable, sustainable mobility solutions mean there’s ample space for multiple players.

Over time, the best technology is likely to dominate, and Gogoro's battery-swapping solution, widely regarded as a leader in the field, has a strong chance to emerge as a key player in India. Its proven efficiency, adaptability, and established global presence provide it with a solid foundation to compete effectively against Honda and others.

**Commitment of Other Japanese Manufacturers to Honda e: Swap**

While Gachaco uses Honda’s technology in Japan, the commitment of other Japanese manufacturers to Honda's system appears uncertain. For instance, Yamaha employs Gogoro’s battery-swapping technology in Taiwan for its electric scooters. This demonstrates their openness to alternative technologies, potentially building separate variants for Honda’s and Gogoro’s systems based on strategic considerations like swapping station coverage. Early adoption of home charging could also play a critical role before swapping networks mature.

It's worth noting that Honda is a member of IBSA (India Battery Swapping Association) with their own brand Honda e: Swap and not Gachaco. It might be a sign of weakness for the collaboration of Japanese manufacturers and I wouldn't be surprised if Honda is facing challenges to convince other manufacturers to use it's Honda branded battery swapping system. Gogoro might have faced similar challenges in the recent past as it has aimed to be profiled as a scooter manufacturer instead of purely battery swapping network company. For example HERO Motocorp wasn't willing to use Gogoro's technology even if they initially signed MoU - although, this might change as Gogoro is repositioning itself back to battery swapping company.

**The Role of Home Charging**

Interestingly, Gogoro initially offered home chargers but discontinued them, focusing exclusively on battery swapping due to its popularity in Taiwan. While this enhances their competitive edge in battery-swapping, it limits accessibility for potential customers without network coverage. Notably, Gachaco introduced a home-charging option in April 2024, which could appeal to users outside network coverage. If Honda adopts home charging for the Activa EV in India, it might pressure Gogoro to reconsider its stance, especially in developing markets like India, South Korea, and the Philippines.

**Gogoro’s Strategic Evolution**

During the Q3 investor call, Henry Chiang stated:  
*""Although we have become a strong brand, we realize that we must return to who we are and get back to our core beliefs and vision for enabling the mass transition of gas-powered scooters to smart electric scooters.""*

This reflects Gogoro's acknowledgment of past missteps. While the company initially positioned itself as the ""Android of EVs,"" focusing on partnerships and battery-swapping technology, it later doubled down its efforts toward manufacturing its own scooters. This conflicted with its original strategy of building scooters primarily to drive demand for its battery-swapping network.

The pivot was ambitious but costly, as competing with established motorcycle brands in price-sensitive markets proved highly challenging. In Taiwan, Gogoro successfully established itself as a market leader, but replicating this success in other regions has been far more difficult due to intense price competition and the dominance of well-entrenched players in the scooter industry. It might have also had a negative impact to attract PBGN partners.

Fortunately, Gogoro seems to be returning to its strengths—its world-class battery-swapping technology. With its innovative solutions and strong financial position, the company has a unique opportunity to solidify itself as the global leader in battery-swapping networks. This focus alone has the potential to grow Gogoro into a multibillion-dollar enterprise.

To succeed, Gogoro must prioritize nurturing its user base and ensuring high customer satisfaction - especially what comes to battery swapping solution. These efforts will be critical for convincing other Powered by Gogoro Network (PBGN) manufacturers to adopt its platform especially in the international markets. With its proven technology, Gogoro is well-positioned to shape the future of sustainable mobility while potentially expanding its business into other areas and become a widely recognized energy provider company.

**Conclusion**

Honda's entry into the Indian market with battery-swapping could challenge competitors like Gogoro. Strategic collaborations, wide network coverage, and customer-friendly options like home charging will likely determine the winners in this space. Gogoro's renewed focus on its core competency—battery swapping—might be the right move to cement its position as a leader in the field while leaving vehicle manufacturing, at least outside Taiwan, to established companies.

India’s EV market is poised for rapid growth, driven by sustainability goals and government support. Experts predict that India could become one of the world’s largest EV markets by 2030, fostering a greener, more energy-efficient future. This week, Honda and Ola Electric introduced new products to the Indian market.

**Honda’s Launches:**

***Honda Activa e:*** Powered by two swappable Honda Mobile Power Pack e: batteries. Honda currently operates 84 swapping stations in Bengaluru, aiming to expand to 500 across three cities by 2026.  
***Honda QC1:*** Features a 1.5 kWh fixed battery, rechargeable at home with a dedicated charger.

Honda’s strategy—offering both swappable and fixed-battery scooters—highlights its focus on battery flexibility. This dual approach could popularize battery swapping in India. Gogoro might adopt a similar strategy by either launching distinct models or integrating both charging methods. To scale efficiently in India, Gogoro could partner with local OEMs while concentrating on its core strength: battery-swapping networks.

**Ola Electric’s Innovation:**

Ola Electric launched a new scooter powered by versatile **PowerPod** priced at ₹9,999. With a 1.5 kWh capacity, it doubles as a portable battery and inverter, capable of powering small household appliances like lights, fans, TVs, and Wi-Fi routers. This solution is particularly valuable for semi-urban and rural areas with limited electricity access.

Gogoro, which currently emphasizes battery-swapping subscriptions, might consider launching a similar home charger. It could power household devices and serve as a UPS, leveraging old batteries for second-life use cases. This approach could attract new customer segments, such as homeowners with solar panels who could store energy in Gogoro batteries.

**Market Potential:**

India’s early-stage EV market holds massive potential. If Gogoro secures a leadership position, it could oversee a vast network of battery-swapping stations and manage millions of batteries. Their upcoming Q4 investor call will likely shed light on their strategy for India, a market brimming with opportunities for growth and innovation.

Imagine a future where all car batteries are standardized and hot-swappable at your nearest convenience store (Solar Array Charging Station)

\--------------

Concept:

You are running low on charge, while you are out and about. You pull into your nearest convenience store, drive into a battery swap stall.

You Click on the pad (like a carwash selection screen) what type of battery you want etc..(performance, standard, Multiple, etc..)

You drive forward into Stall.

A Flat automated moving robot moves underneath your vehicle, removes battery. Stacks it on top of another group of batteries receiving charge.

Another flat robot is quickly behind with your Freshly Charged battery. Inserts it into vehicle.

You get the green light to go!

\-------------

Pros:  
In and out in less time than it takes to fill up a tank of gas.

Make the batteries standardized across all EV manufacturers.

Stackable, mass produced, shared by all in society.

EV Car value is not tied to a depreciating value battery.

Mini Vans, Large Trucks, etc.. could carry 2 long range batteries.

In the future all ""Gas Stations"" are now are like huge battery banks/grid tied. Would help out the local electric grid with Solar Arrays. During a power outage, power can be drawn from the massive battery banks for reverse power.

Cons:

Big Corp would handle power once again in Society.

They would be responsible for battery production/charging stations.

Possibly remove the feature where consumers can charge at home.

\----------

There are way more pros/cons to think of, but overall I think sharing batteries in society and allowing corporations like Exxon, BP, etc.. to handle production/charging would make sense.

This also alleviates the responsibility of battery production of EV manufacturers. The battery not being tied to the vehicle value now makes the EV resale market very lucrative.

I'm sorry if this isn't the right place for this question but this subreddit seemed like the place to ask this.

TLDR: After destroying a set of lithium batteries of my own (charging while frozen), how do electric vehicles charge their batteries while freeing?

A few years ago I swapped the house batteries in my RV from standard lead acid to LiFePo batteries and it was a great decision in so many aspects...until it wasn't. I destroyed $2,000 worth of batteries and now I'm back to using crappy lead acid.

Last winter the region in which I live fell into a deep freeze for several days -- many days in a row seeing below 0°F. Now, I know (I think) lithium batteries can be used while freezing but will suffer damage if charged while freezing. From what I understand, my BMS should take this into account and prevent charging while the temperature is freezing, but for whatever reason it did not and attempted charging them while they were frozen. Originally rectangular cubes, they swelled up little balloons.

So that leads to my question: When an EV has been sitting outside for several hours or overnight in freezing temperatures and charging is needed, upon being plugged in, how does the vehicle go about charging its batteries? I imagine there is a battery heater of sorts, but that would take at least an hour or more to heat the batteries before they could start  charging.",4.3999999999999995,

Electric trains and buses have existed for century. Massive transit systems like Newyork Subway, London underground, Paris metro, Moscow metro, trams and trolleys have been successfully fully running electricity for nearly a century. 

India has electrified 99% of their railway network. It's 75% for china. 70% for France and Spain. 55% for Russia and Germany.

Then we come to electric bikes. They are selling a lot more than electric cars even in USA where there isn't any proper cycling infrastructure.

https://www.bicycling.com/news/a39838840/ebikes-are-outpacing-electric-car-sales-in-the-us/

Trolley buses have existed for decades in many cities. From Moscow to Mexico city.

Electrification of buses with batteries are also a lot more successful than cars.

https://www.sustainable-bus.com/news/bloomberg-new-energy-finance-long-term-forecast-on-electric-buses-vehicles/


 You can have buses with much smaller batteries and use opportunity charging as buses would wait sometimes in terminal any way. Also it's much easier to implement battery swapping for buses than cars. Also in motion charging with trolley bus wires too is possible.

Then we come to resource consumption for cars vs public transportation. Let's take battery needed for electrification. Shenzen has a 100% electric bus fleet. An electric bus would mostly have 500 kWh battery pack. This can be reduced below 100 kWh by opportunity charging (like pantograph charging or battery swapping). Let's be conservative and assume you need 500 kWh battery per bus. And there is one bus per 500 residents in Shenzen. So it comes down to only 625 Wh/person. If they owned cars they would need atleast 15,000 Wh/person assuming one car with 60 kWh battery per a family of 4. This can go upto 60,000 Wh/person or even higher if there's one car per person.

You can also use trolley buses for very busy bus routes. Which would only need a very small battery.

Then the amount of infrastructure needed. One metro line with 2 track (1+1) can transportore people than a 100 lane road (50+50). One dedicated bus lane can transport more people than 6-8 lanes of cars. One cycle lane can transport as much people as a 6 lanes of cars.

Imagine how much land we can conserve with electric trains and buses as opposed to cars.

Then we come to affordability. As said earlier 99% of indian railways and 75% of Chinese railways are already electrified. So I don't think 99% of Indians can afford Teslas or any other electric car brands. But they can definitely afford those trains. China for example has 40,000 km of electrified highspeed railways. And 11,000 km of electricetro railways. 

Then comes life quality. From Beijing to Shanghai it takes only 4 hours and 15 minutes by highspeed trains. It takes a lot more time on an electric car.

https://youtu.be/zYJPOZbhXTA?si=9mriiHBIwzWDWZzG

And let's see how much permanent magnets does electric trains vs cars consume. An electric car has 200 kW to 300 kW motor. And they can transport at maximum 4 people comfortably. So 50 to 75 kW of motor per passneger. 

Even highspeed trains like N700 shinkansen can transport 1323 people with only 17,080 kW motor power. So it comes down to only 12 kW per passeger. Remember this train can travel at a speed of 200 mph (320 kmph). 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N700_Series_Shinkansen


This even lower for normal speed trains which travel at maximum of 160 kmph (100 mph). Take for example Vandebharat EMU. It can transport 1,128 passnegers with only 6,720 kW motor power. So 5.95 kW per passenger. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vande_Bharat_(trainset)

So nearly 10 times lower motor capacity needed per passenger compared to electric cars.

I still think electric cars are better than combustion cars. But they are not the whole solution. Not even a big part of solution towards decarbonization of transportation.",4.199999999999999,

What if the charging network has gaps I don't know about? Plus it's my first major EV purchase - don't want the maiden voyage to be stressful.  
Been researching auto shipping options. The service includes:

EV-specific handling procedures  
Battery safety protocols during transport  
Enclosed options for weather protection  
Insurance coverage for high-tech vehicles

The math: Shipping runs about $1,200 vs maybe $300 in charging costs plus hotels. But honestly, the peace of mind might be worth the premium for my first EV purchase.

I had the chance to visit Seoul recently, and one thing I couldn’t ignore was how common electric cars have become. It wasn’t just Tesla on the roads, but local brands like Hyundai and Kia showing up everywhere. Charging stations popped up in random places, like malls, side streets, and even near convenience stores. For someone used to worrying about finding a charging point back home, that was really eye opening.

What stood out most was how smooth they blended into city life. The roads were packed, but EVs didn’t stick out the way they sometimes do here. The government seems to be pushing for it, and you can tell from how affordable charging costs are compared to gas. Taxi drivers I spoke with even mentioned saving money in the long run, despite higher purchase prices upfront.

I got to ride in a Hyundai Ioniq 6, it was one of the most comfortable cars I’ve been in. It was quiet, smooth, and with leg room. This made me think about how Korea is setting a pace for EV adoption, and how infrastructure really matters. Having charging spots everywhere will quickly dispel the biggest worry with most people considering making a transition.

While looking into brands, I came across listings on Alibaba for EV parts and accessories, which shows just how much the market has spread beyond one country. For me, the lesson from Korea is that an EV only works when the city supports it.

Would you make the switch if charging was this easy in your town?",3.6,

I saw the posts about solar being so fantastically impractical for BEVs etc... so I know this is not a new subject.

I am also quite familiar with the MASSIVE energies required to move a 1 ton+ payload from A to B. And the fact a rooftop solar panel will add only 10-20 miles of range at most on a perfect sunny day.

But what puzzles me is while 10-20 miles a day is aplenty in Europe it's even more aplenty for people who leave their BEV parked a while, say going on vacation or simply commuting a very short distance.

Fisker Ocean, from a defunct company, offered a car roof solar panel claimed to add 1200 miles a year.

Well if the grid collapses (hurricane, earthquakes, riots, war, outage etc...( at least the above BEV won't be a friggin paperweight. And 1200 miles a year will be a lot when you can't charge anywhere at all!

I was looking up comparisons to the Ford Mach E but when comparing the 2, the charging architecture keeps popping up as a major difference (800v on the Kia vs 400v on the Ford). I drove the EV6 for a week, several different charging stations, fastest rated at 350kW. The best rate of charge I got was around 220kW… and from my minimal knowledge, a 400v architecture can reach up to 250kW charging. 

That being said, in the real world, putting a Mach E next to an EV6 at the same charging station delivering up to 350kW, should I expect a significant difference in charge time between them?

I’m sure I’m missing some detail here, but it seems that if the 400v Mach E is still capable of charging at up to 250kW and the EV6 gave me the fastest rate of 220kW, they would charge at a very similar rate… or am I completely lost here?",3.4,

As someone who’s next vehicle purchase is likely to be an EV (it fits my use case perfectly as more than 95% of my driving is to and from work with a <10 mile commute one way), I am curious about “future-proofing.” Advancements in battery tech, including solid-state batteries and the recent claim of an insane vehicle range from China, make me wonder if an entire generation of EVs will become obsolete once these battery advancements become widely commercially available in newer models.

Ideally I could have a functional, reliable EV that is amenable to upgrading the battery once better battery technology becomes available. But that requires the stock battery to be replaceable, the car to accept a new battery with potentially different chemistry and other characteristics, and the new battery to be amenable to being hooked up to prior generations’ systems and motors. Is this “future compatibility” a consideration in current manufacturing techniques? Basically what I’m asking is, realistically, would a current generation EV be able to one day accept a solid-state battery, or would I be required to buy a new car to enjoy the benefits of future battery tech?

Edit:

Ok, the most cogent argument against swappable batteries seems to be that the current generation of batteries is already likely to outlast the rest of the vehicle, meaning it’s never going to make financial sense to swap a battery for the purpose of prolonging the life of the car. Maybe it makes sense for changing the use case (e.g. long-distance hauling instead of local commuting) but that’s a different market altogether.

On the other hand, sounds like some battery swaps are already happening. I wasn’t talking about a hot-swap as a substitute for charging, though, I was talking about an upgrade to change the vehicle’s performance. Old Nissan Leafs seem to be a popular platform for this, but old Leafs had degradation-prone batteries, which no longer seems to apply to modern EVs.

It also makes sense that manufacturers want to sell new cars rather than keep old ones running. I guess I could argue they could also sell proprietary replacement batteries direct to consumers at a profit, but as above that seems like the market for it would be small.

I know that ICE cars are not designed to be modular with engine swaps (doesn’t stop people from buying old ICE cars and doing engine swaps anyway, but that’s a niche market). However, EVs are not ICE cars, so I was curious if the modularity could be different.

I have an EV truck and I bring the unicycle with me everywhere. It goes 25-35 mph easily. I treat it like my mini EV. Sometimes I’ll set up pass through charging for it in the bed of my truck so the wheel is always charged up. Then if I need to stop and charge the truck at a station I just pop the wheel out and ride home or to lunch or wherever I want. Geocaching is fun because the wheel lets me find them fast. On roadtrips I would find 3-4 around each charger.

My favorite trick with this is using PlugShare to find free chargers (usually level 2) at parks, police stations, fire stations, etc. They usually offer free parking for a set amount of time so I charge, ride home and set a timer on my phone, takes a couple minutes back and forth.

I don't really have many concerns about range or charging, the only thing I'm wondering about is battery degradation in certain conditions:

* Does speed and weather affect battery degradation at all? I understand that driving at highway speeds eats at the vehicle's range, which to me is fine, but what does it do to the battery in general? Should I expect to deal with more battery degradation than usual if I consistently drive on the highway? And what about winter's impact on battery degradation? I know I'll have to deal with lower range in the winter, which is also the case with ICE vehicles, but will my battery degrade more in the winter?

I live with a very limited electricity connection (two people living off of a single outlet) and it doesn't look like that will change soon. I've been thinking about selling my current car and getting an EV that is capable of discharging power and moving the stuff that is only powered when I'm home over to that. 

I'd like, as much as possible, to provide my own power. The best way I see to do that is get a gas generator, pump all the power generated from that into the car, and use that to power my room and get me to and from work. Is this sort of plan viable, or is there a better alternative? Is there something I've overlooked or am unaware of?

Edit for clarifications: 

1) when I say single outlet, all the power for our property comes from an extension cord to my neighbors circuit breaker. He is aware of it, and we pay him. For reasons I don't want to go into, the local power company refuses to connect us. 

2) I want to get an EV instead of just using a generator because, as I understand it, when a generator is running it is making a constant amount of electricity. Any electricity made is either used or wasted. If we just used a generator, we would basically never use the full capacity and thus waste a lot of gas. A large stationary battery would work, but since I also need to get around why not sell my gas car and just ride the battery?

3) I'd like to do solar as well, but we don't have any places I'd feel safe putting the panels. The only ""permanent"" structure is a 40 ft sheet metal shed the prior owner built himself, and the permanently stationary RV we live in.

Also, my interest in an EV specifically is more than just for this batshit setup. I have a combustion engine vehicle, and I am thinking about selling it. The generator power setup came from a desire to be able to charge at home and take advantage of the situation to get some privacy; but there is charging infrastructure nearby in the non-shithole part of town where I can charge it if a generator would be a bad idea as a power source. I live fairly close to everything I need, and a week of driving might hit 100 miles. I feel like an EV might be worth the trade even if I still have to fill up at the gas station like my current car.",2.5,

Like many of us, I struggle with staying focused and avoiding distractions while browsing the web. I’ve tried all the website blockers out there – Blocksite, Freedom, you name it. Most of these tools failed for one of two reasons: they were too strict, so I ended up disabling them permanently, or they were too lenient, so I would quickly find a way around them.
To solve this for myself, I built DecayBlock, a browser extension based on the principle of adaptive friction. The mechanism is simple:
1. When you visit a site on your distraction list, a brief timeout is applied before the page loads.
2. This timeout accumulates with each visit, so repeated or habitual access becomes progressively more difficult.
3. Over time, the accumulated timeout decays with a configurable half-life when you stay away from those sites.
The goal isn&#x27;t to enforce a ban (although you can permanently block websites if you choose), but to introduce a small, increasing cost to the act of procrastination. That brief pause is often enough to break the subconscious loop of opening a distracting tab, without ever fully locking you out. You can configure the timeout growth rate and decay half-life to match your own habits.
I&#x27;ve been using this system daily for several months, and it has been significantly more effective for me than any other tool.
DecayBlock is available now on both the Chrome and Firefox web extension stores. Currently it’s only on desktop but I’m hoping to release a mobile version at some point in the future.

I want this to be a healthy discussion and not drift sideways. I just bought a 2026 Tesla Model Y Juniper, my first Tesla, and after only a few days of ownership I’m honestly blown away by what it offers for the price.

For context, my previous car was a 2022 Chevy Bolt EUV. That car was fine for what I paid, about $26,000 after the 2021 tax credit. It got me from point A to point B without trouble, but it was basic. Before ordering the Tesla, I spent real time with other new EVs to make sure I was being fair.

The first was a fully loaded 2026 Chevy Blazer EV with the Super Cruise package. I put about 280 miles on it and came away extremely unimpressed. The Google-based infotainment system is laggy, freezes randomly, and doesn’t have many apps to download from. Apple Music worked, but iPhone integration was clunky. You have to carry a key fob because there is no phone-as-key option. There is no integrated dashcam to record accidents or incidents.

I contacted at least 5 different people in the GM EV Concierge department, including supervisors, and nobody could tell me whether my vehicle had a feature or how to verify or enable it. Super Cruise was the biggest disappointment. Even on mapped highways in perfect weather, it constantly disengaged with “take over now” warnings. On several occasions, it drifted toward the center of a two-lane highway before handing control back, which felt unsafe and made me lose trust in the system. GM’s ads claiming it’s the best driver-assist system? Not even close.

Next, I spent a few days in a friend’s 2025 Ford Mustang Mach-E with Blue Cruise. BlueCruise felt sharper and more confident than Super Cruise, and I trusted it more to stay centered. But the limited mapped-road coverage meant frequent disengagements that became annoying on longer trips. The infotainment system was faster and supported CarPlay and Android Auto, which made daily use easier, but it still felt like a half step behind what Tesla offers.

Then I drove my Model Y. Night and day. I can unlock and drive away using my phone or Apple Watch, and if those are unavailable I can use a simple key card. Driver profiles are a game changer: the car recognizes my wife as she approaches and automatically sets her mirrors, seat, steering wheel, climate controls, and signs her into her music apps. Sentry Mode and the integrated dashcam record possible hit-and-run events or anyone lingering near the car and notify me through the app. Supercharging is effortless. I simply pull up, plug in, and it charges without creating accounts with a dozen different networks. The rear seats fold down and back up at the push of a button, and the interior is roomy and comfortable.

The delivery process alone shows how different Tesla is. I ordered online, scheduled pickup, and avoided dealership games and ridiculous add-ons like nitrogen tire air, $300 wheel locks, or the $600 “opticam” pitch. Other dealers tried to add nearly $3,000 in unnecessary extras. Because of older YouTube videos and forum posts about panel gaps and paint defects, I arrived with a 50-point delivery checklist, expecting problems. I was shocked to find nothing out of place. The panels were aligned, the paint was perfect, and everything worked exactly as it should. Tesla’s build quality has clearly improved compared with the issues reported in earlier years.

For under $40,000 after the federal tax credit, the Model Y delivers technology, convenience, and performance that GM and Ford simply do not match today. After driving FSD, going back to Super Cruise or BlueCruise feels like a huge step backward. The Bolt EUV was a good budget EV, but the 2026 Blazer EV and Mach-E do not justify their $50,000-plus price tags given software and driver-assist shortcomings. Tesla is the benchmark in electric vehicles and the most valuable automaker in the world for a reason. I cannot speak for Rivian, BYD, Kia, or Hyundai yet, but if today’s market is any indication GM and Ford need to step up their game. Tesla isn’t perfect, but after this experience, it’s obvious why it remains the standard to beat.",2.3,

To be completely honest, I've had a PHEV for 5 years, and an Ioniq 6 for the past 2 years. We just drive the PHEV for our long road trips. I just picked up a new Ioniq 5 for a 3 year lease. I took a plane to Los Angeles, and decided to take a two day road trip through the Hwy 395 to Mammoth Lakes to Sonora Rd. In the 25 years of living in California, this is the first time I've ever been to Mammoth Lakes or have driven the 395, and it's something I've been wanting to do forever. I drove over 600 miles in two days, and this is why I don't think I'll ever do a road trip again in an EV.

Main reason? Costs. Nearly every fast charger, including the new Tesla Supercharger network, all costed about 64 cents / kWh. Some were even more expensive at 90 cents / kWh (WTF??). I was thinking the new Supercharger network would be cheaper. I see prices in the Bay Area for about 43 cents. Which isn't that bad. But, what I didn't realize is that these are for OFF peak hours, and only for Tesla vehicles.

At 64 cents / kWh, I estimated that if I had just driven a regular Rav4 Hybrid vs the Ioniq 5 (which averaged 3.9 miles / kWh efficiency for the entire trip, supposedly), I would have spent an extra $31 just to charge the EV compared to $4.40 / gallon of gas for the Rav4. And, not to mention the time it takes to charge.

I estimated that it took me about 35 minutes the first day to get off the road and charge at an EA charger. There was luckily a free 50 kw charger on a rest stop I pulled over after wards, and I stopped for about 15 minutes to charge and use the restroom. This was a good thing because that extra kWh helped me with some range anxiety I had while I started driving into the mountains.

I didn't realize how high Mammoth Lakes would be, but the elevation markers as I was climbing some steep grades were showing 6000' then 7000'. My final destination would be at 9000' elevation. During the drive up, I saw my efficiency drop all the way down to around 1.4 mi / kWh. And, that was pretty freaky. But, I figured I had enough range to make it to the town were they had some Superchargers. So, the range anxiety wasn't too bad. But, the next day, I'm really glad I decided to charge before heading into Sonora Rd. (hwy 108).

I had about 80 miles of range (I charged at the hotel before I left) when I got to a small town a few miles before this twisty scenic road called Sonora Rd. I was thinking, ah, I should be fine, since most of this road should be down hill, and I should be able to get a ton of efficiency. But, I figured, better safe than sorry. I pulled up to this EA 350 kw station, and it charged my car at 200 kw for almost 9 minutes. I was like, DAMNNNN that's FAST. What's funny is this old man in a brand new Subaru Solterra was charging next to me at a 150 kw station, and he asked if it would charge faster on the 350 kw. I said, ""Definitely not for your car. Your car is limited to 150 kw max."" I looked at his charging stats, and at 49% SOC, his car was only charging at 54 kw! LMAO! Wow, no wonder those BZ4x's totally bombed.

I got up to 70% and figured it's time to go. I'm SO glad I did that charge, because I did not realize that the first 20 or 30 miles of the drive would be going up to 11,000' My average efficiency for the first 20 miles was about 1.1 mi / kWh. It was this undulating rollercoaster road that kept going up with lots of switchbacks and tight turns. I think if I hadn't charged, I probably would have turned back and went back to town to charge, wasting a ton of time and energy. But, fortunately, after that, the rest of the 60+ miles were all down hill. By the time I got to Sonora, my efficiency was something like 25 mi / kWh.

All this is to say that road tripping with an EV is expensive, and a bit time consuming. We do a huge 2400 mile road trip every year to Canada and back, and in our Rav4 Prime, there is no headaches, no range anxiety, and gas is cheap along the way. We don't take super long rest stops. 10 minutes is more than enough time for us to pull over, get gas, use the rest room, and do whatever else like take the dog out. I think this road trip for me made me realize that PHEV's are a good thing, and if I ever had to be a one car household again, it would be with a range extended EV or PHEV.",2.199999999999999,

Recently, a friend of mine mentioned not wanting to get an EV because he was concerned about the longevity of the battery (which I know is a common misconception).  

I was thinking about it, and realizing that even if the battery did die in say 20 years, or maybe 200k miles, I feel like at that point I hope there would be plenty of used batteries on the market that you could (in theory) swap in.

So, I think it's an interesting thought exercise to compare it to having a car with 200k miles when the engine blows.

Even if ev batteries are expensive, so are engines.  People routinely use used engines in scenarios like this because a new engine is too expensive. 

Then the big difference I see is the cost of the swap.  Swapping an engine is a HUGE job.  Swapping an EV battery can't be anywhere near as complex.  It will almost certainly require coding to the car after, but the same can be said for swapping an engine. 

I feel like no matter how I look at it, even in the case where a battery is shot, you should be in a better position than you would if an ice engine blew, right? 

Is there a market for used EV batteries?  How much are dealers charging to do a swap?  If you can get your hands on someone to do the coding and understand the risk, are people diy-ing battery swaps?",2.0,

ngw4dv9,reddit,comment,2025-09-29T20:35:35Z,,"That has been the curve for the GTX/AWD previous version I guess? In good condition, it would peak at 190 and charge from 10 to 80 percent in 29 minutes. 

The RWD previous version (mine is MY 2022) eventually got an update back then and since then takes 26 minutes from 10 to 80 percent with a quite flat curve, not going above 135 kW, but holding above 100 kW until just below 80 percent. 

That is was you can expect since then from a 400 Volt EV. 10 to 80 percent is something around 25 minutes, with battery pre-heating it should be possible in most conditions, including heat. With a very big battery (100+ kWh), 400 Volt systems are a big bottleneck and charging takes 30+ minutes, see the BMW SUVs for example (not the ""Neue Klasse). 

800 Volt begins with around 21 minutes (Mercedes CLA, Audi A6 e-tron) and up to below 15 minutes (Xpeng, Zeekr) and even below 12 minutes. In these last cases, you need charging stations with at least 450 kW. 

In my opinion, a quick charging 400 Volt EV with an efficient drive train and a large enough battery (e.g., VW ID.7 Pro S) is always a good option. The 25 minutes may give 350 to 400 KM range. 

But short-range SUVs which take 30+ minutes to give you 200 to 250 KM range ... Nah ...  

Also, having a hungry SUV with a 800 Volt system that take only 15 minutes and gives 250 KM range ... I don't know ... My biggest issue with driving an EV is still that charging stations are not always where I would need them.

For a big hungry SUV, that might mean you need a 350kw charging session if you're only getting 1.5-2mi/kwh. If you're in a smaller more efficient vehicle, 150-200kw is is probably fine.

My 400v Tesla Model Y goes from 10-80 in like 30 minutes. EV6 goes from 10-80 10 mins faster. BUT, generally I'm going from like 10-50 or 60 or so, which is basically 15 minutes in either one given proper charger placement, so it's really not a huge difference either way.

Kia will charger faster then most of the other EVs, but a lot of EVs have substantially more range then the Kia.  At one point I think I penciled it out and the Ioniq 5 could make a 1200 mile trip faster then a Model 3 long range despite the LR having an extra 50 or so miles of range, but ONLY if it could consistently find faster chargers.   A route from the north east headed south for example was mostly NOT going to show off the advantages of a 800v system.

Some EVs have vast range, but don’t charge any faster then their shorter range counterparts, so they look better on paper, but in reality they don’t get anywhere any faster.  Some are not very efficient, so sure you can pump 200kW into them sustained for a long time, and that 150kWh battery holds a lot of power, but when you get them out on the road and they struggle to get much past 2 miles per kWh something like a Mach-e will make a long trip faster.

Some vehicles are much more conferrable, so if you are driving 1200 miles at 75 MPH that is like 16 hours of driving.  For 16 hours of my ass in a car I’ll take whichever seat is more comfortable even if it means 5 more minutes at each charger, maybe 40 more minutes over the day.",0.0,

You're correct on the Mach E. Teslas (not including cybertruck) are 400V architecture vehicles and can go up to about 250kW at superchargers. But there's a key difference. CCS has a maximum current of 500A, so a 400V vehicle can only get up to about 200kW at that current (there's some variance because each pack won't be exactly 400V but it's a decent approximation). NACS does not have a current limit, instead it has a temperature limit on the mating interface in the charge socket. So Tesla can push more current with NACS than what the CCS spec allows, thus they're able to get more power at the same voltage.",0.0,

The V4 stalls are 400V and can hit something like 325kW, but that is going to be pretty rare as Tesla is now starting to deploy 800V for V4 instead of 400V so don't expect those to be more than a footnote in history.  

Unless your vehicle is capable of charging faster than this, there is zero reason for 800V charging, as it will do nothing for you. That said, the future is 800V for sure.  It makes the stalls cheaper because the cable thickness is reduced.  It does nothing for the car itself, and in fact 800V EVs are a negative until the charging infrastructure catches up.

An 800V EV charging on a 400V charger has to up convert to 800V.  The equipment needed to do this is very heavy and expensive.  Realistically, you can't get more than 150kW of conversion, even for $150k cars.  There are 20x more 400V 150kW+ chargers than 800v chargers out there today.

It just makes sense as every vehicle has different sized batteries, better or worse cooling, just weird limitations no one can understand why they exist, etc.  For example, the Model 3 pushes more power at 400V for the first 30% SOC than the 800V eGMP platforms do. It also pushes more power in the first 12 minutes than eGMP does.  However, then the weaker curve of the Model 3 kicks in and the eGMP will have pushed more power over 18-20 minutes than the Model 3.  Why is the curve like this on the Model3?  Probably because they are optimizing adding 180 miles of range to the car so they push the battery harder at first and then have to back off to let the battery cool down.

None of that detail really matters to consumers, though.  What they care about is they roll up at 10% SOC, how long until they have added 180 to 200 miles @70mph back into the car so they can roll on?  You could look at it another way and say how many miles can I add back in the typical stop time of 15 minutes. The Model 3 can add 180 miles in 12 minutes or 200+ miles in 15. The only car faster is the 800V Taycan.

The 800V or 400V doesn't matter because of physics.  The 400V charger can push 250kW and the 800V EV6 can only take 220kW.

The Tesla turns down the charging power earlier than the EV6. This is not because 400V can't deliver the power - it obviously can, since the car is charging at 250 kW at low SoC. 

The real reason is that Tesla do not dare charging their battery cells as hard at high SoC as Kia and Hyundai do. So they start turning down the charging power when the car reaches a certain SoC.

I saw a claim a couple of years ago that if you tried to charge a Tesla battery cell with the same C-rate at high SoC as Kia/Hyundai use, then the cell would only last a handful of charges. I don't remember who said it, but I think it was a spokesperson from the manufacturer of the battery cells used in Kia/Hyundai. So there is probably some bias to the statement, but it also gives a feasible explanation as to **why** Tesla have chosen to be more conservative with their charging curve.",0.0,
nh0q3c7,reddit,comment,2025-09-30T15:13:09Z,,"No it couldn't.  The voltage has ZERO to do with how fast any given car can charge.  The charging speed is all about the battery pack and how well it's cooled.  The battery cells aren't 800V, they are 4.2V.  They are what heats up and determine the charging curve.  The ONLY thing 800V does is give you the potential to charge above 200kW on CSS or 250kW on NACS and it allows you to use smaller wires from the charger to the penthouse.

I don't get why this is so hard to understand.  It's a pipe carrying water.  You can change the size of the pipe or the pressure and achieve any given flow rate.  One isn't inherently better than the other.  Having a smaller pipe in this case is nicer because the person interacts with and plugs the pipe in and a small flexible pipe is nicer.  This is only a problem above 250kW though.",0.0,

I wasn’t claiming to beat high-end EVs or set records. I just took a 1300-mile road trip in my Equinox EV using the Tesla Supercharger network, and it worked fine for me. I stopped 12 times total, averaging 18 minutes per stop and adding about 29 kWh per session. That’s according to my charging history in the Tesla app, and I have receipts for every session.

I generally charged from around 20% to 70%, depending on the situation.

I was driving around 65–70 mph, not a steady 75 mph like in the 1000 km challenge you’re describing. Also, I never said I completed the trip quickly. just that my stop durations were short and the overall experience was fine for me. I made more frequent stops than the 4 stops in the scenario you’re referencing.

Could you clarify what exactly you think I’m being misleading about? Your comment seems to assume I made a claim about total trip time or efficiency that I didn’t. I was just sharing that even with a “worst acceptable” 400V EV, road-tripping wasn’t a problem.

For science, here are all my stops plus an invoice of one of the stops because the CSV export does not show charge duration but that screenshot does. I think that illustrates all of my points clearly.

It is a much much better use of resources to put a solar panel in a fixed location where it can match the sun's tilt and be out of any shade.  Putting it on the car adds weight, it won't be at an optimum angle and it also might be parked or driven in the shade.  Plus, a vast majority of EVs are parked in garages, because that's where the plugs are, so it will be a complete waste on those.  Also, solar panels are often warranted for 25 years (my system is), EVs are warranted for 8 years.  I'll get something like 2-3 times as much useful life out of a roof mounted solar panel than a car mounted one.  Hell, I'm personally on my 4th EV since I installed solar in 2019.  Glad the system wasn't thrown away each time I upgraded the car.

Our Ioniq uses the same 800v as the EV6 and maxes out at around 235-240kW (I think the newer models peak a little higher, but have larger batteries so charge time is similar) and I have personally charged 10-80 in 18 mins on numerous occasions.

2 - the most common non-Tesla chargers in America are the Electrify America ones that could output a maximum of 1,000 volts at 350 amps. Multiply both, that’s 350,000 watts (350 kilowatts). 

3 - that number is way more than most EVs can handle (including large freight trucks like they run in Europe). The chargers are future-proofed. One day there’ll be fleets of cars taking those huge amounts so it’s best to have them chargers in the ground now. 

3 - **greatly simplifying things here**: car makers wire the batteries up in series and parallel in different ways because one way means the battery pack can take more voltage and the other way means they can take more amperage. It’s a cost thing. [It’s cheaper to make a 400 volt car than an 800 volt one.](https://www.drive-electric.co.uk/guides/charging/know-your-ev-the-differences-between-400v-and-800v/)

4 - when you’re charging a lithium battery (in a car, in your laptop computer, in your phone) you can’t just charge at full speed until you’re at 100%. You’ll turn your battery device into a thermal bomb. Once you reach somewhere around 60%, it’s wise to have a system that reads the battery charge and slows things down. And keeps ramping it down as more is added. So when I mention charges in the next part, these are maximums. When the battery is reasonably empty, when the cells are at a nice optimal temperature (above 70°F / 21°C). The way the cars throttle down the charging speed can be plotted on a graph, that’s called a charge curve, and [here is the Mach E curve](https://evkx.net/models/ford/mustang_mach-e/mustang_mach-e_standard_range_awd/chargingcurve/) compared to [the EV6 one here.](https://evkx.net/models/kia/ev6/ev6_long_range_awd/chargingcurve/) The numbers may differ because the charger could give slightly more to the car in volts or amps, or the car’s system has a pre-set curve programmed into it by the manufacturer. 

5 - in the case of the Kia and the Ford you mention, and again **I'm simplifying the numbers greatly** the Ford can take all 350 amps from Electrify America but only 400 volts. Multiply together - that’s 140kW peak. The Kia is wired to only accept 300 amps but can take 800 volts (again: **big simplification**) which makes 240kW peak. This means, for similar battery sizes (my 2024 EV6 has a 77.4kWh battery and the Ford has a 75.7kWh pack for the standard configuration) the Kia can charge from 10% to 80% in 18 minutes and it takes the Ford around 34 minutes on a warm day. ",0.0,

The difference is that amps are what drives heating. You can shove 700 amps for a little bit, but it will make the charging cable and the battery and everything heat up, so you can't do it for long. You have to reduce the amperage to keep the temps manageable. So that Tesla will do 250 kW at 10%, but by 25% the charge rate has started dropping.

If you're charging at high voltage and lower amperage, you are generating less heat, so you can *keep* charging at max speed longer. My EV6 will hold 220 kW up to about 55%, which is why it is a faster charging car despite having a lower max charging speed than the comparable Tesla.",0.0,

ngvn251,reddit,comment,2025-09-29T19:11:51Z,,"If you want to go down a rabbit hole: try to research 800v vs 400v and what it actually means.

The short of it is that the name ""800V"" or ""400V"" are simply classifications or categories. They do not represent the actual voltages that the cars operate in.

Essentially it is:

400V = 400V or less

800V = 400V or more.

There are 800V ""class"" vehicles with a nominal voltage of 520V. That car would be closer to 400V than 800V... (but it is called an 800V car)

All this does is confuse the average customer, who will think that all 400V cars are about the same and all 800V cars are about the same - when it comes to charging. Amperage (current) is also really important because VOLTAGE \* CURRENT (A) = POWER (W). When only talking about voltage, you miss out on the whole other part of the equation that gives you your power.

Then we get into the rabbit hole of chargers. Most CCS chargers are capped at 500A, that is the standard. That gives you a theoretical max power of 400\*500=200,000W (200kW) in a 400V car, and 800\*500=400,000 (400kW) in an 800V car. But, as I said before, the cars are oftentimes not actually 400V or 800V.

Then we come to the topic of Superchargers, that can briefly supply more than the industry standard 500A, even when they are equipped with CCS2 in Europe. So on those, the limit is 250kW on a 400V car - which is why the Volvo EX90 (pre 800V upgrade) has an advertised max power of 250kW, but can only achieve that on Tesla Superchargers - because it needs the 125 more amps that they can supply over the normal CCS standard.

If you think all I am doing with this is trying to confuse you, that is kind of true. The car industry does not have a good standard right now for talking about battery architectures and charging. I get that they are trying to simplify things. But in doing so, they inadvertently confuse people.

If you truly want to know what is going on, you have to learn about actual nominal voltage of vehicles, what current they can receive, and connect that to the standards out there when it comes to chargers. Then you can start understanding what's going on with every vehicle and its charging behavior.

However, I am of course also leaving out other things that are important for the actual charging performance (the charging curve). Up until this point, I have only talked about max power. Other factors like pre-conditioning, BMS, cooling of battery, cooling of charging cable, power sharing etc, all play into your charging curve.

On an energy basis. 

But they do have some interesting advantages when you consider a little bit bigger picture.  One is that they spread the production over a wider time period, so you get to sell electricity during parts of the day when it's more valuable because other people aren't producing, as well as during the regular peak solar times.  The other is that in climates that get snow, including Vermont where they're located, they can be positioned vertical during the snow storm to completely shed the snow and be ready to produce as soon as the sun comes out.  That also means they produce electricity when other solar is not, which makes it more valuable electricity. 

So if you just consider the energy production it probably doesn't make sense, but if you consider the value to the grid, I think they still have a valid business case.

In any practical sense, anyway.

There is a product called the GoSun that is collecting deposits for a solar charging product designed for the scenario you describe.

**It costs $5,000.**

Under *ideal* conditions, it can output *up to* 1.1kW an hour.

EVs use about 300-400kW an hour just to charge, so that’ll net out to about 750kW an hour.

An average EV can turn 750kW into 2-3 miles of driving.

So this device is useful, in sunny weather, from about 12pm to 1pm, assuming you ran out of juice less than 3 miles from the next nearest charger.

Instead of spending **$5,000** on a device that may, theoretically, save you in a very narrow range of scenarios, spend a few hundred on a AAA subscription or just add roadside assistance to your auto insurance.

If you’re 2-3 miles from the next charger, AAA can get a tow out to you in half an hour, maybe an hour max. Probably before you’ve unfolded your solar array and gotten it pointed properly at the sun.

AAA is even rolling out trucks with battery packs and high speed chargers that can, so they don’t need to tow you. Just hook up and charge at 50kW until you’ve got 5-10%.

If so, then I agree that is true. But the threshold you gave of 2,000W (2kW) is probably 10x off.

>The EV6 Light Long Range RWD can travel up to 310 miles on a single charge. The base EV6’s range is 232 miles, and the EV6 GT has a range of just 218 miles. With DC fast charging, the battery can go from 10% to 80% in as little as 18 minutes.

>With the Extended Range battery pack, the Mach-E’s driving range is also 310 miles. With the standard battery, the single-motor version can travel 247 miles, and the dual-motor can travel 224 miles. At a DC fast charging station, it takes about 38 minutes to charge the standard battery from 10% to 80%. The same task with the larger battery takes about 45 minutes.",0.0,
ngvl8mf,reddit,comment,2025-09-29T19:02:58Z,,"I believe the newer Mach Es max out at 150kW, not sure where 250kW came from in your research.

E-gmp max at ~235kW for the pre 2025s, 2025+ are closer to ~260kW afaik.

Check out the 10%-80% charge times for the e-gmp vehicles vs the Mach-e. 18 minutes for most e-gmp, vs 36 minutes for the newest Mach-e.

If you never drive more than 400miles in a day and can charge at home, you’ll never notice the difference.

BUT, if you like to road trip fast, you’ll want something with 800v. I did 600 miles in one day in my 22 ioniq 5 a few weeks back, gps said it would take 10 hours no stops. It took me 10hr 40 mins total with charging stops. I hit 235kw every stop, longest stop was 15 minutes, and shortest was 7. I couldn’t have done it faster even in an ICE.

So yes, it does make a difference, but only if you’re a somewhat impatient road tripper like me.",0.0,
ngvklne,reddit,comment,2025-09-29T18:59:51Z,,"400v and 800v is a very loose categorization. 400v is generally any voltage under 400v, and 800v is any voltage over 400v. Charging speed is going to be a combination of voltage and current. And the charging speed won’t be constant for the whole charge. It often varies due to thermal throttling. And the max current is typically based on the size of the wires and other components. So, in general, the higher the voltage, the higher the charge speed (kW) that can be achieved with similar component sizing. And it can be sustained for longer before being thermal throttled.

ngyk446,reddit,comment,2025-09-30T05:29:39Z,,"LOL. Sure. I suppose someday that solar panels might 5x in efficiency for energy delivered vs. surface area. Maybe then it will be viable. Of course, that will make solar panels 100% efficient, which is not possible. 

Until that day, nope.",0.0,
ngx53hx,reddit,comment,2025-09-29T23:51:48Z,,"Yeah, I’m an electrical engineer who specializes in industrial remote battery systems, some with solar panels. Solar is far less reliable and has far less output than you think it does. My installations are typically in the 200 watt/hour SLA battery kinda range, the gear draws 1-3 watts on standby (probably about 5-10 times what a car computer draws in standby) with 300-ish watt PV arrays. 

I think it’s a gigantic waste of money and effort to tack this on a car for anything but charging your cell phone or running a cabin fan, but go ahead and try it yourself… but you probably won’t. 

If you’re really running your EV battery out to the point where you think anything less than a 7kW array is going to save you (only) during lunchtime hours, you probably deserve the long walk home. BTW, AAA has a remote charging roadside service for this… and guess what? They work at night, unlike your solar array. 

The main problem is, solar doesn’t put out anywhere near the published specs for more than a couple hours a day, and even those conditions have to be ideal and near the equator on a clear day. You’ll be lucky to see 20% of that number if a cloud passes in front of the Sun. 

I never leave the house unless I can make it back home (or to a L3 charge station) with at least 20 miles on the battery. That is a safer and much cheaper plan than trying to rely on some janky rig of PVs and a 240v inverter duct taped to the roof of your car. 

Sorry to pee in your Cheerios on this, but it’s a mega colossal waste of money to DIY this. It won’t work.",0.0,

>And batteries would never give us a car with a 100 miles range were arguing those who saw the GM EV1 in 1999... you agree right?


I'm not sure what you're arguing here. The sun is going to get thousands of times more powerful in the coming decades? Because if not, this is a dead idea. But again, you don't want to listen so I encourage to make and market your idea.",0.0,
nh0v2bx,reddit,comment,2025-09-30T15:37:24Z,,"Okay figured it out. The AC charging standard sets a minimum in A not kW. This is 6A. For me on 240V that's at 1.4kW. I've programmed my Wallbox Pulsar Plus to limit depending on solar output and when it's under 6A the car won't take a charge. If you are on 120V that would be 720W. I'm pretty sure every car sold has this 6A minimum cause the charger will never send less due to the protocol.

The losses along the chain are also a factor. To get a charger to even produce 1.4kW you probably need a 3kWp system, 2kW might no even be enough.",0.0,
ngx22uq,reddit,comment,2025-09-29T23:34:39Z,,"For practicality incorporating them in a car that will be parked a while only makes sense given the alarm system will cover it too. The reality is a lot of people are criticizing this solution without ever having a car with solar panels in it... Kinda like the ICE crowd making fun of BEVs without any of them having actually EXPERIENCED one.

Imagine being drained of your battery and instead of calling a tow just let it sit a while and be able to continue. And the peace of mind coming with it.

I have been there and frankly for the wait I could have put 100-200 watt hour in my car and made it to the next charging station.",0.0,

In case you havent heard the cost of gasoline has tone up in the last 7 years and unless you live in California the cost of charging is vastly lower in most other areas. My wife drives our ICE minivan and I have a very inefficient EV, we drive the same amount a year and she spends $2000 more a year on gas than I do on charging.
